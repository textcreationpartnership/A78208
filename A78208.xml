            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>At the Battle of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> Roſes were there ſold in the publick Piazza, in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> as red and freſh as they are in <hi>June:</hi> From whence all aſſur'd themſelves of a ſignal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, that the Chriſtians ſhou'd ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain againſt the Turk's. This Lilly therefore Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> bears, betokens thoſe extraordinary qualities and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, wherewith he is inrich'd; and therefore the Painter who firſt put it into his Hand, was, as I ſayd; without doubt inſpir'd from Heaven to do ſo, ſince this Branch of Lillies, ſilently hint's at whatſoever can be ſaid of him; and even manifeſts all thoſe wonders, that lie hid in this Great Saint: As I ſhall hereafter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to explicate.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore do but learn the price and excellency of the Lilly, and thereby you'll know the eminent and admirable Perfections of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive alſo that wonderful and almoſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170805:8"/>incredible Love, which God had for him. For as a Lilly is the grace and ornament of a Garden of pleaſure; as 'tis the beautiful Maſter-piece, that draws the Eyes, and charms the Hearts of the beholders, at their firſt entrance into it; ſo according to Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> there are no leſs charming Lillies in the Garden of Heaven:<note n="†" place="bottom">Floribus caeli neque roſa neque liliae deſunt. <hi>Aug. ſerm.</hi> 11 <hi>de Sanctis.</hi>

                     <p>Now let us ſee how beautiful and ſweet a Lilly Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> is; for ſince the heavenly Spouſe is highly pleas'd with a feaſt of Lillies; therefore Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> had the honor to be invited to it, next after the Bridegroom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dilectus meus mihi &amp; ego illi qui paſcitur inter lilia. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.26.</note>

But before we Contemplate Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> let us take a view of the Lillies Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which is an Emblem of him.</p>
                     <p>The Lilly ſurpaſſes all other odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Flowers in growth, as well as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170805:8"/>beauty, ſhe raiſes her beautiful head upon a ſtreight ſtalk, many feet high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than any other Flowers do; as Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> alſo in the height of Juſtice and Perfection, ſurmounts all other Saints: Wherefore when we behold Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> leading his reputed Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in one Hand, and the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in the other, we cannot but admire, to what a height of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity God has rais'd him, and muſt own, that none ever was rais'd to the like; and that ſuch a Dignity as this, is not given in the Houſe of God, but according to the Sanctity and Graces, the Perſon rais'd to it, is partaker of; and which the Miniſtry he is imploy'd in, do's require.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and higheſt degree of all Honors and Dignities upon Earth, was due to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Son of God In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate; the ſecond, to the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Mother of God; and the third, to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Spouſe to the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and Foſter-Father to the Son of God. Wherefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the moſt devout and learned Doctor of the Church, Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> our Lilly Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> is rais'd alſo, after <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> to the higheſt Dignity upon Earth,<note n="*" place="bottom">Eo fuit excellentior, quo ad al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorem ordinem pertinuit. <hi>S.

                     <p>The Lilly alſo is an Emblem of pure Love, and ſprings from a Heart, the ſource of Love, which it's Root re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles; and in this it reſembles alſo our Saint <hi>Joſeph:</hi> Who, next to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> exceeds all Creatures both in active and paſſive Love; his Heart was moſt inflam'd, by being reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with the Love of God towards him, which mov'd his Divine Majeſty to raiſe him to the higheſt Dignity on Earth, next to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> And Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> reverberates and caſts back theſe Flames towards God, by a faithful correſpondence, and fidelity in thoſe high functions, to which he had choſen him; which render'd him moſt amiable both to Heaven and Earth, as I ſhall hereafter prove more at large. So that we ſee how the Lilly is a lively Emblem of our Saint, and that this Lilly he holds in his Hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates ſomething that is great, and what is beyond our power to expreſs. The very number alſo of the Lillies leaves, betokens thoſe ſix wonderful priviledges, which the extraordinary Love of God, mov'd him to beſtow upon our Lilly Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi>

                        <hi>Margaret</hi> Queen of <hi>Navar</hi> took for her <hi>Device,</hi> a crown'd Lilly, at which two rich Pendants of Jewels were hung; with this Motto:<note n="*" place="bottom">Mirandum naturae opus.</note>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170805:9"/>may alſo be very well apply'd to Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi> The Lilly is his Enſign, and is not only the wonder of Nature, but of Grace alſo; upon which, hung thoſe two rich Jewels, <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> whom he led in each Hand, bearing the Title of Father to the one, and of Husband to the other; he therefore juſtly deſerves to be Crown'd, ſince in the Love of God he bears away the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe from all; both in the Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant and Triumphant: So that none muſt dare to diſpute the right of Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with him, he having thoſe high Prerogatives beſtow'd upon him, from which all others, except <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> his beloved, Son and Spouſe are excluded. The part and portion alſo he has of Divine Love in this Triumph, is very remarkable, and gives him a place in that title, which his great Progenitor <hi>David</hi> gave to the 44.

                        <hi>The Triumph by Lillies.</hi> Making him partner in this Triumph with the two other Lillies <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> theſe being all, and always of a Company. Wherefore ſince this Triumph partly belongs to him, I may conclude him a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror with the other two, and that this his Triumph, is as much above that of all other Saints, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds them in thoſe wonderful Graces and Prerogatives, which the Love of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170805:10"/>God beſtow'd upon him: This will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be perceiv'd by diſplaying the ſix Leaves of our Lilly, and diſcovering thereby the ſix extraordinary Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, the Love of God has beſtow'd upon him, above all other Saints, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Head or Bloſſom of this Flower contains, as I ſayd, ſix white reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Leaves, which repreſent the ſix particular and extraordinary Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, that ſhine in Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other Saints; Wherefore 'twill be ſufficient only to open and diſplay theſe ſix Leaves, to let you ſee the wonderful novelties they contain, and thereby both raiſe your Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Perfections, and charm your Affection to ſuch a height, with Love and Devotion to him, as he truly deſerves. Novelties, as we find by experience, contain a certain luſtre within themſelves, that cauſes admiration, and therefore they need not borrow words or diſcourſes to ſet themſelves out. A Beauty inrich'd by Nature, as you know, needs neither Paint nor Patch; a Diamond of great price wants no foile to ſet it off. A Cabinet alſo fill'd with rich and ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling jewels, declares it's own value, and therefore needs no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, than to ſet it open; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining within it ſelf it's own light, luſtre and beauty. The Leaves I am about to diſplay of this glorious Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170805:10"/>are of the ſame ſtamp or nature, ſo that by giving you only a ſight of them, as of ſo many unheard of Prerogatives, they cannot but raiſe your admiration of his Perfections, and even charm and move you to a Devotion to him.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Leaf or Prerogative I lay open, cannot but cauſe a ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; for is it not wonderful that a Son ſhould chooſe his own Father? 'Tis a wonder never before heard of in the World, ſince it's firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Read the <hi>Roman</hi> Annals, turn over all the Hiſtories of the Univerſe, you'll find nothing like to this, and were this a practice that cou'd be brought into the World, what a change wou'd it make in it? Poor, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, Imperfect and Vicious Men, wou'd never be choſen for Fathers: None but ſuch as were Rich, Prudent, Vertuous and every way Accompliſh'd, wou'd be made choice of; from whence we may conclude, that a Perſon who is choſen by one that is very Prudent; muſt needs be very Good, Beautiful, and moſt Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd in all kind of Perfections.</p>
                     <p>Now to apply this to our Lilly, to our Glorious Saint-<hi>Joſeph.</hi> You know that the Son of God, by right of his Divine Exiſtence, had a Being before his Human Birth; and therefore had the advantage of Time, in which he might chooſe his Father; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170805:11"/>his deſign, to chooſe one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, 'tis certain his infinite Wiſdom, wou'd make choice of one moſt Perfect and Eminent in San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity; and of one that were moſt fit and moſt capable, for ſo high a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: For if a Worm, like my ſelf, wou'd make choice of the braveſt of Men for it's Father, had it an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offer'd to do ſo; can we imagine that the Son of God, the Eternal Wiſdom, who judges of things as they are, knows the value and depth of Hearts, and ſees the worth of all Creatures, wou'd not chooſe the moſt Perfect of all Men for his Father? To think otherwiſe, wou'd be to rank his Wiſdom beneath our own. Wherefore ſince he has choſen Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> before all others, ſince his Knowledge and Love mov'd him to this Election, muſt not this choice he made of him, be an evident proof, that he was eminent in all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? Eſpecially ſince the Divine Wiſdom it ſelf choſe him for his Father?</p>
                     <p>Let us now paſs on, and take a view of the ſecond Leaf, or ſecond Prerogative of our glorious Lilly. He was not only choſen by the Divine Wiſdom to be his Father; but even to be Father to him, who was the Son of God. So that by this Election which the Eternal Wiſdom made, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> had God for his Son. Who cou'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170805:11"/>have thought it poſſible, that a Man cou'd be Father to the Son of God? Or cou'd ever have imagin'd, that Man might with truth ſay to the Son of God, you are my Son? Or that Man ſhou'd arrive to ſo high a pitch of Dignity, as to bear the relation of Paternity, to the Word Incarnate? Which in ſome meaſure reſembl'd, the Paternity of the Eternal Father, to his Eternal and Uncreated Son. O wonderful Dignity! <hi>Joſeph</hi> Father of <hi>Jeſus!</hi> Father of the Son of God In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate! Having the honor to be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him upon Earth, to whom God is Father in Heaven: But to evidence, and make this Truth more clear.</p>
                     <p>We muſt know, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was not his Son by Nature, but by the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Right that accru'd to Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi> by <hi>Jeſus</hi> his being Son to his Spouſe, the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> For by his being her Son he was Produc'd in, and Born of that Fleſh, which by right of Marriage was Saint <hi>Joſeph's,</hi> and was under his power and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. So that according to the common axiom of the Civil Law, that ſays:<note n="†" place="bottom">Quid in alieno ſolo naſcitur vel aedificatur, ſub illius dominium cadit cujus eſt ſolum. <hi>Inſtitut, de rer. diviſ.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Whatſoever grow's in, or is built upon anothers Soil, belongs to the owner thereof:</hi> This title was ſtrong enough,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170805:12"/>to give him the right and title of a Father, and caus'd our Bleſſed Lady, to ſtile him his Father even to her Son himſelf, when ſhe ſayd,<note n="†" place="bottom">Pater tuus &amp; Ego dolentes quaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bamus te. <hi>Luc.</hi> 2.48.</note> 
                        <hi>Behold with how much Grief your Father and I have ſought after you;</hi> he alſo by his Anſwer, ſeem'd to own him for his Father upon Earth; when he ſayd,<note n="*" place="bottom">Neſciebatis quia in his quae patris mei ſunt opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet me eſſe. <hi>Ibid v.</hi> 49.</note> 
                        <hi>Knew yee not, that 'twas chiefly my duty to take care of my Fathers buſineſs?</hi> Meaning his Heavenly Father, as if he wou'd have ſayd, you have reaſon for what you ſay, but you know that my firſt and chief obligation, is to comply with the Will of my Heavenly Father.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all; Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> was not only the Father of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> becauſe he was call'd ſo; or becauſe he had that relation to the Bleſſed Virgin I before ſpoke of; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wanted nothing, that is found in a true Paternity, or Fatherly Right. He had all that care, affection, and authority, that any Father ever had, or ever will have, in relation to a Son.

                     <p>The third Miraculous Leaf or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of this Lilly, is, that being Man, he ſhou'd become Husband to the Mother of God. O wonder of wonders!

If therefore ſhe be a Princeſs he is a Prince; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170805:13"/>he alſo is King, where-ever ſhe is Queen. For God who deſign'd to raiſe <hi>Mary</hi> to the quality and honor of the Mother of God: At the ſame time deſign'd her a Husband, like to her ſelf; whom he lov'd above all Men upon Earth, and therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd him with all Graces ſuitable to ſuch a Dignity.

                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth Miraculous Leaf or Prerogative of this Lilly, is, that he is at once both a Father and a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.

                        <hi>O Nurſing-Father to him who feeds all Creatures. O Rich</hi> Joſeph, <hi>to whom God himſelf becomes a Beggar! Thrice happy art thou, who haſt him for thy Debtor, who lends to every one whatſoever he poſſeſſes; for all Creatures are indebted to God for their Being, and for every thing they Enjoy: But to oblige thee, God will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come oblig'd to thee; and make himſelf
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170805:14"/>thy Debtor</hi> Wherefore let us joyn our Admirations and Congratulations with thoſe of the Angels, ſaying; O thrice happy <hi>Joſeph,</hi> favorit of the Court of Heaven! O beſt Beloved of God! ſince he has plac'd ſo great a confidence in thee, as to commit his only Son to thy Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth and laſt Miraculous Leaf, or Prerogative of this Lilly, is, that he is one of the Perſons of the Created Trinity, which is next in dignity to the uncreated; and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully alſo reſembles all the three Perſons of the uncreated Trinity; as the Lilly alſo do's, which he bears in his Hand; For in a white reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cup or Throne, it includes three Golden Septers, all three equal in Odour, Beauty and Shape, iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the middle or heart of the Flower; which reſemblance, gives no little honor to the Lilly; ſince it mak's it a ſimilitude, whereby to declare the Majeſty of this Divine Myſtery. Nor is it any leſs honor to our Lilly. Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to reſemble the three Divine Perſons, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, which he do's after ſuch a manner as might raiſe a jealoſie even in the Angels; to ſee that God has beſtow'd upon Man, ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of that Myſtery, which in it ſelf is the moſt wonderful of all Myſteries; did they not Adore, with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170805:15"/>all poſſible Submiſſion and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Divine Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in all things. For as the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father, is the Father of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created word, ſo Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> is the reputed Father of the word Created: And as God the Son is the Redeemer of Mankind; ſo Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> is his Coadjutor in this great work; ſince he imploy's all his cares, all the labours of his Hands, and all the ſweat of his Brows, to gain where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to nouriſh and maintain our moſt Merciful Redeemer. Laſtly as the Holy Ghoſt is the Spouſe of <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of God, ſo Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> is alſo her Spouſe. What therefore can be a greater Subject of jealoſie to the Angels than this? But they know him to be a favorit of God, and therefore rejoyce as much in the honor God beſtow's upon him, as in their own; and honor him as a Prince of their Grand-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Court, and as one he will have thus honor'd.</p>
                     <p>After having thus diſplay'd theſe Miraculous Leaves; and declar'd the wonderful Prerogatives of our Lilly, I cannot refrain from bleſſing and praiſing the Divine Providence, for inſpiring the Painter to put a Lilly into Saint <hi>Joſephs</hi> Hand, by the help of which, the ſame Providence has been pleas'd to inſpire me to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Merits and wonderful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives.

For we cannot imagin that <hi>Ieſus</hi> wou'd permit ſo ſtrict an alliance of his Beautiful Mother, with a Man who had any Perſonal Defect. For what Father is there that chooſes not the moſt accompliſh'd Perſon to Marry his Daughter unto? <hi>Gerſon</hi> affirm's that in his Face or Countenance; he reſembl'd and was very like to <hi>Ieſus,</hi> the moſt Beautiful amongſt the Sons of Men; the<note n="†" place="bottom">Facies <hi>Ieſu</hi> erat ſimilis faciel Ioſeph. <hi>Gerſon.</hi>

                        <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was made to the likeneſs of the Bleſſed Virgin his Spouſe.</hi> So that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170805:17"/>they are all alike in Beauty, in which they exceeded all others. Thus much therefore may ſuffice for the diſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Beauty in general, now let us deſcend to particulars.</p>
                     <p>His Face caſt forth ſuch rays of Beauty and Sweetneſs, as charm'd all that beheld him. One ſight of him was ſufficient to win the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the beholders, and move them to a Devotion to him. This, Siſter <hi>Iane of the Angels,</hi> Prioreſs of the <hi>vrſulins</hi> at <hi>Lodun</hi> teſtifi'd; when the Painters ask'd her (after Saint <hi>Ioſeph's</hi> Apparition and Miraculous cure of her Health) how they ſhou'd draw him; for having deſcrib'd to them his Fore-head, Eyes, Noſe, Chin, Beard, Hair and all the reſt of his Features, after the beſt manner ſhe was able; ſhe added, make uſe infine of all the advantages your Art ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of, or is able to perform; yet after all you can do, you will never be able to expreſs the Beauty of his Countenance. And when they ask'd her whether he was as handſom as ſuch and ſuch a Perſon; make him as much handſomer than theſe you ſpeak of as you are able, yet after all, you will come ſhort of his Beauty; it being impoſſible truly to expreſs it, as it is. I muſt therefore forbear to endeavour to expreſs by Pen, what they were not able to expreſs by their Penſils; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170805:18"/>with this ſhort deſcription, that in Beauty he was next to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> whoſe Beauties were above what can be expreſs'd by Words, and are even beyond any idea or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination can be fram'd of 'em.</p>
                     <p>Yet to give you ſome glimps or ſhadow of his Beauty, I am aſſur'd that when they ſhew'd this Devout <hi>vrſuline</hi> his Picture at <hi>Paris</hi> as ſhe paſs'd by, which <hi>Hurlet</hi> the Famous Engraver had made, to repreſent the Miracle of her Recovery; ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd the Face had many Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures like his, and that it had ſome reſemblance of that Majeſty, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in Saint <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> when he Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to her, and at the ſame time perfectly cur'd her. Which mov'd me to get a Plate Ingrav'd after that, tho' far ſmaller (which you may ſee in the Frontiſpiece of this Book) which the Graver has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with ſo good ſucceſs, that it contains ſuch a Majeſty and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as ſtrike both a Reverence and Affection into the beholders; and gives 'em a glimps or ſhaddow of his heavenly Beauty.</p>
                     <p>Moreover an agreeable exterior, a ſweet and pleaſant converſation, are no leſs charming than Beauty: Which Saint <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had in very great Perfection, as well from his Natural temper, as from the many Years converſation, he had enjoy'd with tho
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170805:18"/>Word Incarnate, and with the Queen of Angels: For in him the leaſt defect in this kind; wou'd have been very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious; he being deſign'd by God to treat and converſe with thoſe Kings, whom he inſpir'd, and led by a Star to Adore his Son; and not only to treat with Kings but even with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves, ſent to him upon ſeveral Embaſſys, to inform him of the Miſtery of the Incarnation; of the Name he ſhou'd give his Son; of <hi>Herod's</hi> deſign againſt his Life; to warn him to fly with him and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e gain'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very on's Affection and Eſteem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his own; he being hereby not the leaſt puffed up with any ſelf-love or ſelf-eſteem; nor did he, as it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily happens, become leſs affable upon account of theſe honours done
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170805:19"/>him, but receiv'd 'em with ſo baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a modeſty, and ſuch an angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſweetneſs, as declar'd that he look'd upon himſelf as undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, of the eſteem and love they ſhew'd him; more admiring and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their goodneſs, than his own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. So that this his ſweet diſpoſition, this his excellent humour, together with his beautiful and pleaſant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which breath'd ſuch an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, joyn'd with winning and Angelical Modeſty, as render'd his converſation both pleaſing to Men, and Angels, nay even to God himſelf. So that the Interpretation of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Dream, was verifi'd in our Saint <hi>Joſeph;</hi> for the Sun of Juſtice and ſhe who was as beautiful as the Moon, even the Son and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, both admir'd and even reverenc'd him.</p>
                     <p>But all theſe are only exteriour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and nothing, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the interiour he poſſeſs'd; I mean thoſe Vertues that adorn'd his Soul; for nothing is ſo lovely as Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and nothing renders any object ſo worthy of Love as Vertue do's. And this it was that made Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> gain ſo great a conqueſt over the Hearts of all that knew him: For he was Charitable, Patient, Meek, Humble, Devout, Obedient, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine was all that either the reputed Father of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or the Spouſe of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170805:19"/>
                        <hi>Mary</hi> ought to have been. And tho he had not of himſelf been ſo Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in theſe Vertues; yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant converſation with ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Paterns of them, as <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were, cou'd not but render him alſo moſt eminent in the ſame. For as one who lives in a perfumer's ſhop, do's not only take pleaſure in the ſmell of the perfumes round about him, but is thereby perfum'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo the Vertues of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> were increas'd by theirs, with whom he conſtantly Liv'd and Convers'd.</p>
                     <p>What I have ſayd, cannot, I am ſure, but raiſe in your Hearts ſuch a Love and Devotion to this great Saint as their's was; whoſe Examples I ſhall hereafter recount, and at the ſame time, ſhew how great this Love and Devotion ought to be: That is to ſay, it ought to be next to our Love and Devotion to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>

Wherefore we muſt conclude, that ſince he was ſo amiable, they cou'd not elſewhere lodge their Affections better, or give a preſent of their

Theſe other great Saints hold indeed the firſt place in their Rank and Hierarchy, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinary Law of Love; but not in that of the Order of the Hypoſtatical Union, and in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Incarnation, wherein thoſe are only compris'd, who moſt nearly relate to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> namely Saint <hi>Joſeph;</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats this Created Trinity as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſignifi'd; and therefore makes a Hierarchy apart, of far greater Excellency and Dignity than the reſt.</p>
                     <p>But ſtill to ſet forth more at large Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Dignity, I will here declare the Source and Order of this Hierarchy, which comprehends none but <hi>Jeſus, Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph?</hi> We muſt therefore take notice, that God who is admirable in his Works, was not content only to make Man after his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170805:21"/>own Image and Likeneſs, but wou'd alſo make a Created Image and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Increated Trinity; in theſe three wonderful perſonages, <hi>Jeſus, Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph;</hi> whom he choſe for the Miſtery of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation. So that as the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Increated Trinity, have all Cooperated to the Sacred Myſtery of the Incarnation; ſo they wou'd alſo make an Illuſtrious and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Emblem of themſelves, to Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate likewiſe towards the ſame Miſtery. For Example, firſt in the ſubſiſtance of the two Natures of JESUS CHRIST, his Soul, Body and Divinity, are United in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Son of God. So by the Union of the admirable Love and ſingular Report that theſe three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>Jeſus, Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> have to one another, they Contributed to it upon Earth; <hi>Mary</hi> bears the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God the Father, <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Son according to his Humanity, in a juſt likeneſs to what he is in Heaven, as he is the Word or Son of God. And Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Holy Ghoſt in the quality of Spouſe to the Bleſſed Virgin, or in the Love he had for <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> which he manifeſted, by the care he took both of the one and of the other.</p>
                     <p>What Affections therefore are due to this Admirable and Venerable
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170805:22"/>Created Trinity, as the Learn'd <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſtiles it, either in general or in particular? And if the greateſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be confer'd upon them by this Title, why ought not the greateſt Love to accompany it? If Love attends Merit, what can be next the Uncreated Trinity, but the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? And next to the Father Son and Holy Ghoſt, but <hi>Jeſus, Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who ought to take the next place in our Affections. And as it wou'd be amiſs for any one, firſt to Love God the Father, ſecondly to Love God the Son, and then, breaking the Order of the Trinity, to Love one of the Angels; place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Ghoſt in the ſame Rank with theſe Holy Spirits, ſo infinitely inferiour to him in all things; if therefore this wou'd be very Prepoſterous; ſince by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his firſt Affection to the Holy Ghoſt, he wou'd refuſe him the firſt of all poſſible Devotions, which he deſervedly challenges as his Right; it being an undoubted Truth, that we cannot render a greater Honour than by Love, and by offering our Heart in Homage. Wherefore as none can divide their Love and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to the three Perſons in the Uncreated Trinity, to give it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, no more can they do ſo in order to the Created Trinity: But muſt Love <hi>Jeſus, Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:170805:22"/>after the Uncreated Trinity, before any other object tho' never ſo Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and therefore to Love <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and in the next place to Love any Saint or Angel, wou'd be to break the order of Love, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come injurious to this Created Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, robbing it of that Honour God has given it; and 'twou'd be to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who ought to have the third Rank in the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of our Affections; which wou'd clearly appear no leſs a Defect of Judgment, than of Devotion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our greateſt Devotion after that to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> ought to be to Saint <hi>Joſeph;</hi> without any fear or apprehenſion; that any Saint or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel will thereby be diſoblig'd; they all giving him the precedency, knowing very well, what Honour and Devotion is due to the Spouſe of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of God, and to the reputed Father of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Son of God, and to the third Perſon of the admirable Created Trinity, of <hi>Jeſus, Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> What was the reaſon why it was ſo long, before Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> the beſt belov'd of God and moſt amiable of all the Saints, after <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> had ſuch a Love and Devotion payd him, as was du to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Merits?</head>
                     <p>THO' I dare not preſume to penetrate into God's hidden Councels, nor pretend to a knowledge of his Divine Secrets, by permitting my curioſity to make inquiry why God has not permitted the wonderful Splendor of Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Glory, to break out, and ſhine forth, till theſe latter Years, permitting ſo many Years ſince the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170805:23"/>Incarnation to paſs, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary knowledge or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the wonderful Merits of the Holy Spouſe of the Mother of God; yet I hope it will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a raſhneſs in me, to aſſign ſome motives that appear very reaſonable; ſince all that I pretend to herein, is only to declare my own Thoughts, grounded upon ſuch obſervations, as are taken from the ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which the Divine Providence has us'd in ſuch like accidental oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: And hereby alſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a Devotion to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which was the chiefeſt deſign I had in Writing this Treatiſe; that by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning the Underſtandings of his Clients, I may prepare a way for Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> to gain a higher place in their Affections.</p>
                     <p>We know that his Feaſt has not long been kept, with that ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as now it is: And that in the Primitive Ages, no mention is made of any particular Devotion to this Saint; nor no ſuch notice taken of his Canonization, as is now adays in practiſe concerning other Saints. I cannot therefore but own, that this Devotion towards Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> is only of late ſtanding, ſince the moſt Ancient marks of Honour ſhew'd him in ſeveral places, are but of a very freſh date; as we may gueſs by the Confraternities, Chappels and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170805:24"/>Altars erected in his Honour, both in <hi>Italy, Germany</hi> and ſeveral other places; of which I find the City of <hi>Avignion</hi> to be the firſt that was ſo happy, as to expreſs any Devotion to him in this kind; for in the chief Church in that City: there is a fair Chappel Dedicated to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in which there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity of Batchelors, and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dality of Virgins; who aſſemble themſelves upon his Feaſt to hear Maſs and Veſpers, which are ſung in this Chappel with great ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; to gain thereby the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences granted by the Pope, where each of theſe Virgins has not only a Loaf of Holy Bread preſented 'em as in other Confraternities, but a Poſy of Flowers alſo, which they carry along with 'em in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
                     <p>This Devotion ſeems to have had it's riſe or beginning from <hi>Gregory</hi> the XI. in the fourteenth Age, for in a certain Chappel in the Church; Dedicated to Saint <hi>Agricula,</hi> there is an Altar-piece of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> accompanying and conducting the Bleſſed Virgin and her Infant <hi>Jeſus</hi> in their flight into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> which Church both ſhews the Liberality of this Pope, as well as his Devotion to Saint <hi>Joſeph;</hi> whoſe Coat of Armes is plac'd round about the Chappel Dedicated to this Saint, in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170805:24"/>great Scutchions of Stone; ſo that 'tis more than probable 'twas he that began the Honours given to this Saint, in this Ancient Church of <hi>Avignion,</hi> where he held his Chaire or Holy Sea at that time. Who moreover at the ſame time increas'd the revenues of the Canons of the Church of <hi>Agricola.</hi> This is the firſt place, in which I find any publick Honors and Devotions done to Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi> So that 'tis not much above three hundred Years, ſince we find any Fooſtteps of any extraordinary Devotion to this Saint; and if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, there were any, they were but very ſmall, and far remote from the Primitive Ages; God by his Divine Providence thus ordering the Conduct of Devotion to great Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But why did God ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale the wonderful Merits of this Saint, without encouraging Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by a knowledge of them, to exhibit that Love and Devotion to him which is now every where pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd? The chief reaſon that occurs to me, is becauſe this Devotion wou'd have given too great an advantage and encouragement to the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> who began betimes to rob CHRIST of his Divinity, and maintain'd that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was his Natural Father. This Hereſie not only Sacrilegiouſly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divinity of JESUS CHRIST,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170805:25"/>but the Virginity alſo of his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Mother.</p>
                     <p>Now Men as we know, being ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily carried to Extreams, and to an exceſs in honoring thoſe they eſteem and love, reflecting upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable excellency of the Spouſe of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> they might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have believ'd, and taken him for the Father of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> Son to the Bleſſed Virgin; eſpecially meeting with ſome, who were of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but now we are out of the danger of any ſuch erroneous cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, and all that Sect of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who were Enemies of CHIST's Divinity, and the Virginity of our Bleſſed Lady, are ſilenc'd and ſhut up in an everlaſting Priſon; there is no danger of extolling his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which caus'd him to poſſeſs ſuch eminent Glory in Heaven; and to deſerve ſuch a Love and Devotion upon earth, as was next to that of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover tho' there had not been this danger of giving countenance to ſo great an Hereſie; yet this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Devotion ſuits better with theſe latter Ages, in which the world draws towards an End, which ſtill decaying in Piety and Fervour, ſtands in need of ſome Spiritual Cordial (as I may ſay) to warm it's Chillineſs and Tepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and to inkindle Fervour in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170805:25"/>Hearts of the Faithful; for which end nothing cou'd be more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, than a Love and Devotion to this great Patriarch, and Favorit of God. There are now one thouſand ſix hundred ninty and eight Years paſt, ſince the Law of Grace took it's beginning, by the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Saint <hi>Joſeph;</hi> who had the charge of the Word Incarnate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him. And can it end more happily and with greater Glory, than under his conduct alſo? procur'd by the affectionat acknowledgements, applauſe and devotions of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to this their thrice obliging Benefactour and Parent of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And by their cordial and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgement to the Father of our King, and to the Spouſe of the Queen of Heaven and Earth: Hereby alſo God wou'd manifeſt to the World, that in the Beginning and in the End of the Law of Love, which are the two Gates of God's Church, and of the Law of Grace; he wou'd have <hi>Joſeph</hi> the moſt Chaſt and Holy-Spouſe of <hi>Mary,</hi> appear glorious and noble in this his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and faithful in his conduct; that thereby he might deſerve the Triumph of a Poſſeſſion of our Hearts, by our Love and Devotion to him; wherefore to him may be well apply'd theſe words of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170805:26"/>
                        <hi>Proverbs.</hi>

                        <hi>Her Husband is Noble in the Gates.</hi> Or as the <hi>Caldaick</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation has it, <hi>Her Husband is known in the Gates;</hi> at the Entrance and going out of the Law of Grace. that is, he is honor'd with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick mark of a Senator, which was to be plac'd at the Gates where ſuch Men only were wont to ſit.</p>
                     <p>For tho' it wou'd have been an incredible ſatisfaction to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to have had him as much Lov'd and honor'd during the whole time of the Law of Grace, as now; yet God wou'd reſerve this Joy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment for theſe latter Years. And therefore the Devout and Learn'd <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> was wont to call this Age in which we now Live, the Age of Saints. He judging the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons that arrive to an eminent degree of Sanctity, by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Petfection the chief and whole ſtudy of their Lives, to be far greater in theſe our Days, than ever ir was in former Ages. No time therefore cou'd be better for the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging and ſerving Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the greateſt of Saints, than the Age of Saints; wherein the Splendor of his Perfections might appear ſo much the more Glorious, by how much it had been for ſo many Ago<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:170805:26"/>Eclipſed and lain under a Cloud. O how wonderful is God in all his Deſigns: And how good is he to us who Live in this Age? Since he depriv'd former Ages of the Beauty of this Sun, and ordain'd it ſhou'd break through that Cloud it lay hid in, in this our Age, to give us this moſt bright Day, and to move us to a ſervent Love and Devotion to Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover the Divine Providence has in this (which is one of the chief works of Grace) acted after the ſame manner as he do's in the rareſt Maſter-pieces of Nature. 'Tis his ſpecial Favor that permits us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſight of theſe Beautiful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which are the product of his Divine Creation. Such as are Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Rubies, Emerods, Pearls and all other ſorts of Precious Stones; that gives us alſo a ſight of Gold, Silver and other reſplendent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; yet there are far greater Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this kind, buried in the Bottom of the Sea, and in the Bowels of the Earth, than ever we have yet ſeen or heard of His Bounty let's us alſo behold, the many Beautiful Flowers, Plants, Trees, Birds and Beaſts, together with that wonderful and agreeable variety of ſo many beautiful Faces of Men, Women and Children, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Univerſe; yet God has
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170805:27"/>layd up and kept a reſerve of all theſe Objects, far more Beautiful than any we have ever yet ſeen. He permits us alſo to behold the moſt glorious objects, of the Sun, Moon and Stars; tho' their diſtance hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us, in ſome meaſure, from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that wonderful Beauty they contain in themſelves. But there are far greater, richer and more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Objects than all theſe in the Empyrial Heaven, which God has ſtill conceal'd from us, which are as far above the Sun in Beauty; as the Empyrial Heaven is above it in Height. Tho' God's Liberality and Bounty towards us, in affording us the Contemplation of all theſe Beautiful Objects, is a great mark of his Goodneſs: Yet he has been far more gracious towards us, in ſhewing us the wonderful works of his Grace, than in diſcovering to us the foreſaid works of Nature: By giving us ſome knowledge of thoſe wonderful ornaments of the Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Heaven; eſpecially of thoſe two great Luminaries <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> which adorn and imbeliſh his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Pallace, together with a great number of other Saints alſo, who like ſo many Blaeing Stars Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his <hi>Caeleſtial Hieruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Peace:</hi> And tho' we muſt own our ſight too ſhort, and even too weak to behold theſe great
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170805:27"/>Lights, whoſe number is beyond our caſting up, and whoſe Beauty and Glory exceed our Imagination; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we can have no full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat knowledge of 'em, till we be ſo happy as to enjoy their company by being plac'd with them in the Celeſtial Court. Yet we muſt never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs acknowledge this imperfect and abſtractive knowledge he gives us as a ſpecial favour, and alſo that he has after ſo extraordinary a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, been pleas'd to diſcover to us in this our Age, one of the Richeſt Treaſures of Heaven, for Greatneſs, Sanctity and Glory, which for ſo many foregoing Ages he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from the World, that we may inrich our ſelves by paying due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and affection to him, whom he had rais'd to the honour of being the Foſter Father of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and Spouſe of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and hereby gain thoſe Heavenly Bleſſings, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſuch a Devotion. And 'tis no leſs for Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour than our greater merit; that God has reſerv'd the diſcovery of his Merits, till our Days.</p>
                     <p>We alſo know, that except the work of Creation, of all things out of nothing, that nothing is done here upon Earth, without fit Diſpoſitions and due Preparations. The Painter prepares his Pallet with Colours, and primes his Cloath, before he begins
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170805:28"/>to Paint. The Architect ſquares and makes ready his Timber, Stone and other Materials, before he begins to Build. The Gold-ſmith refines his Silver and hammers out his Plates, before he begins to imboſs his Work. Ladies make up their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modes, all their other Ornaments and Rich Attire, before they Dreſs or Adorn themſelves. A good Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritian prepares and diſpoſes his Matter and Figures, to adorn his Oration, before he Compoſes it. Nay we ſee that even all ſorts of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans, prepare both Tools and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to work upon, and great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are made, before any excellent Piece of Work can be accompliſh'd and when 'tis done, 'tis alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Beholders ſhou'd be duly inform'd, and well diſpos'd for the better conceiving, underſtanding and admiring it's Perfections. God therefore would diſpoſe the World to conceive and underſtand the great Perfections of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> before he wou'd diſcover to them ſuch a Maſter-Piece.</p>
                     <p>And not only Art, but Nature alſo do's produce her Works by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, nor do's ſhe furniſh them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many Previous Diſpoſitions and Trials of her Skill.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170805:29"/>his chief Maſter-piece his Holy Church. For to what End did he ordain ſo many Ceremonies in the Old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law? Why was he ſo careful of all the Ornaments of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Temple, as even to Ordain that the very Snuffers and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, of leſs Moment, ſhou'd be of Gold? It was becauſe the beholding all theſe Ordinations and Ceremonies, ſerv'd to his Elect People as an Aprentiſhip; to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and learn both the Excellency and Sublime Practices of the New Law, that JESUS CHRIST was to Eſtabliſh; theſe ſerv'd as Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations whereupon that was to be built; and to diſpoſe us to that Perfection as was requir'd, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by thoſe Sacraments inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Law of Love, which the Divine Wiſdom was to Eſtabliſh in his Church. 'Twas therefore for this End that he brought up his Elect People in the Exerciſe of ſuch a Multitude of Ceremonies in the Old Law, that he might hereby diſpoſe and bring them by little and little, to that ſolid Devotion and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requir'd in the New.</p>
                     <p>We alſo ſee that the Written Law God gave to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> Perfected the Law of Nature, and the Law of Grace Perfects both the Law of Nature and the Written Law; and God made uſe of all theſe to bring
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170805:29"/>us to that Perfection, which the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Prerogatives of his Grace prepar'd us to obtain; the better to entertain him, with ſuch Fervour and Devotion as he requir'd, when he ſhou'd favor us with his Divine Preſence.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee that God both by himſelf and his Creatures, prepares, diſpoſes, brings about, and perfects all his deſigns by degrees. And we ſee the reaſon why God for the ſpace of near ſeventeen hundred Years has diſpos'd and order'd that particular Honours and Devotions, ſhou'd be perform'd by his Servants to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Saints, for particular benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by their Interceſſion; for he beſtow's upon each Saint ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Grace or Priviledge; to move the Faithful to a particular Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that particular Saint; give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one Saint the power of cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Diſeaſe, to another the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of curing a different Diſtemper; to one Saint power to help us in one Neceſſity, to another Saint pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to help us in a different Exigency; to one Saint he gives the priviledge to obtain one Vertue for us, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to obtain ſome other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Vertue; and why did God do all this, but to move his Servants to a particular Devotion to the Saints in general? And to move and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us alſo to a Devotion to each
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170805:30"/>Saint in particular, when we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their help in ſuch a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity as God had given that Saint a particular power to help us in. And why, has God reſerv'd to this laſt Age the declaration of the Merits and Power of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but that the Devotion wherewith he had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd us to give to each Saint in in Particular, might ſerve us like ſo many diſpoſitions and ſteps to raiſe us to ſuch a Devotion to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as he merits above all other Saints, next to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> he having all that Power united in himſelf, which God had diſtributed amongſt all other Saints, whereby he was able to cure all Corporal and Spiritual Diſeaſes, both of Soul and Body, and to help his Clients in all their Neceſſities whatſoever; his Dignity and Merits challenging this extraordinary priviledge above all other Saints, except <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> to the end therefore that all the particular Devotions exhibited for ſo many Ages, to many different Saints, might be united and offer'd to him, and that all might have Recourſe to him in all their Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, God has diſcover'd to us that all the power he had before Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated and Diſtributed to ſeveral Saints, is united and given to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he having all Power given him next to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the ten particular Clients of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who by their Pious Examples have invited and mov'd us to a particular Devotion to him, next to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Clients of Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> daily increaſe, and are already become ſo numerous, that there are few or none, that deſire not to be inrol'd amongſt 'em. All the Clients of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> have alſo Conſecrated their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him, in acknowledgement of his Amability, and of the Love which his reputed Son <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Virgin Spouſe <hi>Mary</hi> have for him; their Mouths and Pens expreſs the deſires
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170805:31"/>and wiſhes of their Hearts; ſaying, <hi>Long Live</hi> Jeſus Mary <hi>and</hi> Joſeph, theſe are now become their Aſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, adding <hi>Joſeph</hi> to the common Aſpiration of Devout Souls, <hi>Long Live</hi> Jeſus <hi>and</hi> Mary; and their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent prohouncing, of theſe words, is a ſignal mark of the Victory he has gain'd over their Chaſt Affections. It has been heretofore a ſingular Devotion of ſome Perſons, who were particularly Devoted to the Vertue of Purity, to add <hi>Alexius</hi> to thoſe two Venerable Names of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and, <hi>Mary,</hi> but ſince this Lovely Sun Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> has peirc'd the Cloud, under which he ſo many Years lay hid, all change their notes and cry out <hi>Jeſus Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Jeſus, Mary, Alexius,</hi> giving Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> his own, yet without leſſoning their Devotion to <hi>Alexius,</hi> whom after Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> they honor alſo with frequent Aſpirations, <hi>Live</hi> Alexius, <hi>O let</hi> Alexius <hi>Live.</hi> But they knowing the Merits of Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be of a different and higher rank, upon account of the alliance he had with the Vertues of his Holy Spouſe, and with the Miſtery of the Incarnation; which render'd him, as I have ſayd, one of the Created Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, where he takes his place; gives him a preference, above all other Saints; tho after him every one may take <hi>Alexius,</hi> or what other
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170805:32"/>Saint they are particularly Devoted unto, for the Object of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Affection.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and chief of thoſe, who were tenderly affected to Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> was <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of God. For tho' our Bleſſed Lady was firſt by the date of time, that Lov'd her Spouſe; ſince her Love began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore JESUS CHRIST her Son was Born; yet 'tis not to be doubted, but that the Saviour of the World incomparably more Lov'd and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd him, than our Lady did. And therefore tho' her Love was prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as I ſayd, in regard of time. Yet the Love which <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as Son of God, had for him before time, was above our imagination, and beyond the power of Angels to expreſs; he lov'd him as his Father, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Son lov'd a Father as <hi>Jeſus</hi> did <hi>Joſeph;</hi> nay joyn all the tender Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that all the Children that have ever yet been, have ever had for their Fathers; yet the Affection of <hi>Jeſus</hi> to <hi>Joſeph</hi> tranſcended 'em all; he had in proportion the ſame ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Affection for Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which he had for his Virgin Mother; and prefer'd none upon Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> excepting her ſelf, perfectly fulfilling the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of honoring his Father and Mother, with greater exactneſs and tenderneſs of Affection, than ever
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170805:32"/>any Child in the World did; and lov'd him alſo as it became ſuch a Child to love ſuch a Father, ſo Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo Tender, ſo Careful of him, ſo Singularly Obliging to him, as he was upon ſo many accounts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jeſus</hi> lov'd him alſo as a Saviour for ſaving him from the Cruel Hands of <hi>Herod,</hi> by flying with him into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Whereby he became even the Saviour of his Saviour. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he lov'd him as his Nurſing Father, as Foſter'd by his Sweat and Labours; he lov'd him moreover under the title of his Angel Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. Other Perſons have inviſible Angel Guardians given 'em by God; <hi>Jeſus</hi> alone had no Angel Guardian given him, his Divinity being ſo ſtrictly united to his Humanity was to him a ſufficient guard; wherefore God gave him Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> as a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Guardian, which honour he confer'd upon Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> for the ſpace of thirty Years, he bearing all that while the title and office of Conductour, Tutor and Governour of the <hi>word Incarnate.</hi> Moreover the very Name and Right of a God-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, appointed by God himſelf, was another motive of <hi>Jeſus's</hi> extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary affection towards Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Infine ſuch was his Love, that as the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church recounts, out of ſome Revelations, he lov'd him as the Apple of his Eye. The Saviour
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170805:33"/>of the World (as <hi>Iſidorus</hi> recounts out of very Grave Authors) enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his Diſciples upon the Life of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſpoke thus of him,<note n="†" place="bottom">

                     <p>If you ſtill deſire to ſee the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this his extraordinary Love, know that generally he favour'd him with all the particular Marks of his Love, whereby he has ever favour'd any Saint.

                     <p>'Twas a ſignal Favour Saint <hi>John</hi> receiv'd, by laying his Head upon his Maſters Sacred Breaſt; and what knowledge of Secrets and Miſteries did he draw from thence? But how many times has <hi>Jeſus</hi> reſted his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Head upon Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Breaſt? Whilſt he carried him in his Sacred Armes, tenderly Embracing and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing him, both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in his journeys to <hi>Aegypt</hi> and elſewhere; and how many Secrets did he then Communicate to him?</p>
                     <p>'Twas eſteem'd a particular Favour to Bleſſed <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula</hi> of <hi>Valence,</hi> when our Saviour appear'd to her cloath'd in Epiſcopal Robes, and giving her his Bleſſing. And at another time, when be Enter'd by Night into her Chamber, whilſt ſhe was at her pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, more Bright and Glorious than the Sun, tranſporting and filling her Heart with Divine Comforts. Great was the happineſs our Saviour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded his Apoſtles by three Years continual Converſation with them, ſeeing his admirable Example, and hearing his Divine Wiſdom. But Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſurpaſs'd all theſe, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with him not only three but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170805:34"/>thirty Years together, ſeeing and hearing this Divine Word. Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him not in an Epiſcopal but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taculous Habit, that grew as his Body did, and this not as he was paſſing from one place to another, but conſtantly in his own Houſe; not receiving one but innumerable Benedictions from his Divine Hand.</p>
                     <p>We Read alſo of an extraordinary favour that our Saviour did Bleſſed <hi>Jane</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> when he ſat down at table with her, at no other Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet than that of three Hearts, ſerv'd up upon a Plate of Gold. Which were his own, his Mothers and Hers. The Apoſtles alſo enjoy'd the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Eating with him at <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus's, Simion's, Zachaeus's,</hi> Saint <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew's</hi> and ſeveral other Tables; But was it not a far greater favour that Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> enjoy'd, of being his and his Mothers conſtant Gueſt, ſitting at Table with them, having his Soul fed and ſet on fire with the Inflam'd Words, that proceeded from the Heart and Mouth of the Son of God, and from that large Heart of his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Mother, where ſhe had laid and hoarded up all thoſe Myſteries ſhe had both heard and ſeen.</p>
                     <p>We admire the Viſions he beſtow'd upon his Apoſtles and other Saints, at his Transfiguration upon Mount <hi>Thabor,</hi> and by ſeveral Apparitions after his Reſurrection, or Aſſenſion

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170805:35"/>above all others, whoſe Heart was fill'd with moſt delicious Dying Thoughts; for as the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church, I before cited, aſſures us, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour aſſiſted him in his laſt Agony, leaning on his Pillow, taking him by the Hand, and receiving his laſt Breath from his Lips; and at his laſt Groan, clos'd his Eyes, ſhut his Mouth and form'd his Viſage with his own moſt Divine Hand, to give him a graceful Aſpect, at his laſt farewell.

Whoſe Converſation was a ſecurity to her unblemiſh'd Reputation, againſt any reproach that cou'd be made concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her Virgin Child-Birth.

To let us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that as he was ſubject to him in all things upon Earth, as to a father who Commanded him: So he was the ſame in Heaven; grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him whatſoever he ask'd. This was Saint <hi>Tereſa's</hi> opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her great Patron, to whom ſhe was ſo particularly Devoted, that ſhe endevour'd to invite all to take him for their particular Patron and Protectour.

'Twas he that found out the true eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Star, and that it's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent was next to the Virgin Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                     <p>The Devout <hi>Henry Chycot,</hi> Canon of <hi>Chartres,</hi> deſerves the tenth place amongſt the Clients of Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph;</hi> all his thoughts being taken up how to augment his honour, either by himſelf or others. He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to write a Book, upon his Marriage with the Mother of God, in which he endeavour'd to ſet forth his Praiſes; but not being able to finiſh it, that Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> might looſe nothing by his Death, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd himſelf by Letter to his Friend <hi>John Gerſon,</hi> obligeing him by all the tyes of Friendſhip between them, either to perfect this Work he had begun, or to make one of his own upon the ſame Subject: Which he perform'd, both to ſatisfie his Friends Piety, and his own Devotion to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Canon alſo that he might
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170805:43"/>the better evidence his ſignal Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in his laſt Will and Teſtament, left a conſiderable Sum of Mony as a Foundation for a Yearly diſtribution to the Canons, to oblige them Daily to ſing his Hymn and Prayer in his honour; hereby to habituate them to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of honouring and recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves to this Saint.</p>
                     <p>Behold here the ten Lovers of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> given us for an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple how to honour his Merits, and how to put our ſelves under the ſhelter of his powerful Protection, with aſſurance of the confiderable advantages we ſhall gain thereby. But he has had very many other Clients beſides theſe of both Sexes, the number of which wou'd make too long a liſt for ſo ſhort a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; yet I cannot omit the name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few more of them, as firſt Bleſſed <hi>Joſeph Herman</hi> of the Order of Saint <hi>Norbert,</hi> who for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> deſerv'd to have the Name of <hi>Joſeph</hi> given him by the Bleſſed Virgin; who as <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> relates in his Life, deſerv'd her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him alſo ſo great an honour as to take him for her Spouſe; becauſe he honour'd her deareſt Spouſe Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</hi> And as a token of indearment, put her little Infant JESUS into his Armes, that he might carry him
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170805:44"/>therein as Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> had done. Father <hi>Peter Cotton</hi> alſo, of the SOCIETY of JESUS, ſo well known all over <hi>France</hi> for his rare Vertues, was alſo particularly Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which mov'd him to procure that the firſt Church in <hi>France,</hi> that was honour'd with his glorious Name, ſhou'd be Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him at <hi>Lyons,</hi> near the place call'd the <hi>Bellcourt.</hi> He had ſo tender an affection to him as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he mov'd Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> to Reveal to him the Day of his Death, and to procure it upon his own Feaſt. Saint <hi>Bridget</hi> and Saint <hi>Gertrude</hi> were commanded to be his Devotes, and doubtleſs executed ſo advantagious a Command. And thoſe happy <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites, Ann</hi> of Saint <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who in this imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated their Foundreſs Saint <hi>Tereſa,</hi> were his conſtant and ferverous Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. I ought here alſo to recount, thoſe Writers who with ſo much Zeal have ſet forth his Perfections; as Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> Saint <hi>Bernardin</hi> of <hi>Sienna,</hi> Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logus,</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi> the late <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Arana, Charles Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, Peter Moreles, Stephen Bennet, Charles</hi> of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and many others, who have ſet forth his Praiſes. Nor ought we to forget thoſe many Devout Souls of our
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170805:44"/>own acquaintance, who have had a great tenderneſs for his Service, whereof ſome are ſtill liveing, both in the World, and out of it in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and others gon to Heaven to reap the Fruit of this their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
                     <p>But if theſe Examples have not force enough or power, to effect what I pretend, I ſhall endeavour to propoſe in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſuch congruous and eaſie De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions to this Saint, as will of themſelves incite us to Practiſe them.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the ordinary Devotions that may be Daily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed towards Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>ACTIONS are proper language and beſt expreſſions of Love, they teſtifying by effects the truth of our good wiſhes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations to the Perſon we Love. What do's the frequent repetition of I Love you, I honour you great Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and eſteem you above all Saints after <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> if this Love and Honour halts or ſtops heer, and makes no farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs than our Lips?</p>
                     <p>Wherefore all that I intend to ſay, is to make our Love to this Saint no leſs effective, than affective; not that I require that every Point I ſet down ſhou'd be put in Practice, but I propoſe ſeveral, that the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader may make choice of that,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170805:45"/>which moſt of all pleaſes him; and all of 'em are ſo eaſie and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that none but a Soul that is harden'd againſt, or diſguſted with what conduces to her Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, can diſlike or be diſpleas'd with any of 'em.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Devotion is to have an Image or Picture, either in our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Book, or Oratory: And this was that which his Devout Client Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> practis'd; who as her Life informs us, ſet up over the Gates of all the Monaſteries ſhe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Statues of <hi>Jeſus Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and wherever ſhe went, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with her a Picture of Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> which Picture is ſtill kept at <hi>Avila;</hi> nameing and ſtyling him the Founder of her Order. And that which occaſion'd this her. Devotion, was a Conference our Saviour once had with her, after ſhe had Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for ſhe being croſs'd in the Foundation of the Monaſtery of Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> at <hi>Avila,</hi> CHRIST bid her uſe all her endeavours, to build this Monaſtery, promiſing it ſhou'd be his own Work; and that it wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d be very agreeable to his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, wou'd redound much to his honour, and that he ſhou'd Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be ſerv'd therein; and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her to call it the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to ſet up Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> and the Bleſſed Virgins
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170805:46"/>Statue at the Gate: Promiſing that he himſelf would with them be Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian thereof. Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Will, put all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in execution, ordering the Images to be plac'd as he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd. Perhaps you'll tell me you have neither Houſe to build, nor any Foundations to make. Pardon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e if I tell you, you lye under a great miſtake, ſince you have the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Perfection to raiſe, the Foundation of a Vertuous Life to lay, you are alſo to employ your Thoughts about an Habitation that you muſt live in for all Eternity. One of the beſt means therefore to compaſs this great Work of our Salvation, is a tender Devotion to Saint <hi>Joſeph;</hi> this is the beſt means to finiſh the Edifice of Perfection, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to our ſelves a happy and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Habitation. What Devotion therefore can be eaſier than this, only to keep the Spiritual Image of Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> in our Thoughts, and to procure it by carrying it in our Books; by keeping it in our Cloſſet; and by leting it put us in mind to call upon him, whom the Image repreſents, and to beg his aſſiſtance in all our neceſſities. By the help of ſuch an Image, a Gentelman of <hi>Venice</hi> was drawn from a moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, to a moſt happy State of his Soul, which had otherwiſe been loſt.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170805:46"/>The Story I ſhall hereafter relate, in the XI. Chapter with ſeveral others therein ſcited, which prove the care he takes of the Spiritual Malady, of thoſe who are Devoted to him.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Devotion I propoſe. is a particular and ſingular affection to ſome Myſtery of his Holy Life. Such as was that of his Marriage to the Bleſſed Virgin; his Flight into <hi>Aegypt</hi> with our Saviour and the Bleſſed Virgin his Spouſe; or any other like unto theſe. Bleſſed <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> of the <hi>Holy Croſs,</hi> was wont to ſix her thoughts upon his happy Death, in the Armes of our moſt Merciful Redeemer: And did I know to which of theſe my Pious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Inclinations wou'd moſt of all lead him, I wou'd promote his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion thereunto. But inſtead of this, to ſhew how pleaſing ſuch Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe, are to Almighty God, I will here relate what happen'd to a Devout Client of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a Religious Man of the Monaſtery of <hi>Monferat</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> who was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Devoted to his voyage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with JESUS and his Holy Virgin Mother.</p>
                     <p>It fell out that this Religious Man, returning once very late to his Monaſtery, loſt his way and wandred ſo long up and down a Mountain ſome diſtance from it,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170805:47"/>that at length he gave himſelf for loſt; by reaſon of the contagious effects that were occaſion'd by the unwholſome Fogg's of that place; or becauſe he fear'd to become <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Prey to the Mercileſs ſavage Beaſts of which the place was very full; his fears and apprehentions increas'd with the darkneſs of the Night, and caus'd him to recommend himſelf to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den he meets a grave Man leading an Aſs, which had a Woman upon it, bearing an Infant in her Armes; this happy incounter, gave him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> wonderful Comfort, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd when asking the way to the Monaſtery, the Man who lead the Aſs, bad him follow him, and he wou'd lead him the right way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: As they went their whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was of God, and this with ſo much Fruit, that never in his Lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the Religious Man, even in Prayer, had felt the like Sweetneſs; which was accompanied with no leſs Joy, when he ſaw himſelf enter into the Village in which the Monaſtery was; which joy was follow'd with no leſs aſtoniſhment, when on a ſudden his guide Diſappear'd, as ſoon as he had thus brought him out of all danger. Which gave him preſently the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that 'twas Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> that had brought him out of this trouble, and danger he was in, whereby his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170805:47"/>Devotions to this great Saint was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, and alſo to that particular part of his Life, to which he was before ſo particularly Devoted.</p>
                     <p>The third Devotion, is to ſay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day, or at leaſt once a weak, his little Office; which is in the <hi>Key</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> which is Printed at the end of this Book; for the greater conveniency of thoſe who deſire to make uſe thereof. This Office contains a continual Praiſe of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in which ſome of his Devotes, who ſay it Daily, others who ſay it every Saturday, find great Comfort, and no leſs Profit alſo: And the great advantage that the Clients of Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, is his readineſs always to acknowledge them as ſuch, and to aſſiſt 'em accordingly, as appears by what ſome Years ſince happen'd at <hi>Loudun</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>

Two or three Days after ſhe had made this Vow, the Wicked Spirit left her at the firſt Exorciſme leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Croſs on the Fore-head of the ſaid Religious, as the Exorciſt had enjoyn'd him, and at the ſame time another Devil cry'd out, Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> is come, and has caus'd <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi> to depart.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Devotion, is Daily to recite the Litany of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which contain all the cheif Paſſages of his Life, together with all the extraordinary Priviledges God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon him.

Wherefore they tranſported themſelves thither, but found ſo little ſatisfaction at their firſt arrival, meeting with ſo great and ſo many difficulties, that they cou'd not ſo much as find a Houſe to hire to live in, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they reſolv'd to return back to <hi>Aix</hi> from whence they came; but firſt, had their Recourſe to Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> whom they had taken for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector in this their Deſign, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd for nine Days together to ſay his Litany after Maſs: But what appear'd as a wonderful effect of their Devotion, before the end of the nine Davs, a Prieſt of great worth and authority, who had built a Houſe, and a Church adjoyning to it, in honour of Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> near the ſaid Town, came to find out the Superiour, to make her an offer both of the Church and Houſe, and to put her in Poſſeſſion of all things elſe belonging thereunto. Which ofler they accepted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170805:50"/>the Religious took Poſſeſſion of it, and were ſettl'd there by the eſpecial favour of Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Who not only took them into his particular charge and care, but plac'd 'em under the protection of his great Devote and dear Child Saint <hi>Tereſa,</hi> in a Houſe and Church where ſhe was greatly honour'd, and where ſhe deſir'd her great Patron Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhou'd be honour'd alſo.</p>

                     <p>THERE is no place through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole World where the Feaſt of Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> is kept with greater Solemnity than in <hi>Canada,</hi> a Country in the Nourthweſt part of <hi>America.</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Father, the Patron, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of new <hi>France.</hi> 'Tis for this reaſon that his Feaſt is ſo Solemnly kept there: And that we may ſee how 'tis kept, I will here ſet down (what I took out of a Relation Printed in the Year 1637. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how they Celebrate it, is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; Upon the Vigil of his Feaſt is ſet up the Standard of <hi>Kebec</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of the chief <hi>Baſtions,</hi> and at the diſcharge of a Cannon or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Piece, the Governour of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170805:54"/>cauſes very Artificial Fire works to be Lighted.</p>
                     <p>On the one ſide there is rais'd a Pillar, upon which there Appears the Name of Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> in Fire, in very large Characters, over which from a Crown of Stars, made in Fire-Works, are caſt out a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Serpents that fly into the Air, and behind it are plac'd a great many Rockets, which alſo fly a great height, and there break into many Stars, that fall from them.</p>
                     <p>Neer this Pillar is rais'd a fair Caſtle richly Painted, and ſet out with great Variety of Colours, flank'd with four Towers, beſet with ſo many lights and fire-works as inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the whole Battery, whith is alſo ſurrounded with a great many ſaming Spears, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Flags beſpangl'd with Fire, appear from the tops of the Towers, from whence there continually aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend a great many Serpents made in fire-works. Six and ſix at a time into equal diſtance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and alſo many dozens of great Rockets, twelve at a time, reſting ſome while between each dozen. At the cloſe of the Evening the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Kebec</hi> (accompanied with all his Officers, in ſight of a great number of Savages that live round about the Country, and come thither to ſee the Solemnity) put's Fire to

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>'s great occaſion to the Savages to honour and eſteem Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> for whom they perceive the Chriſtians to have ſo great a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Upon the Day of his Feaſt, they alſo, expreſs very great Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all their Churches, where all things are perform'd with as great Solemnity as upon <hi>Eaſter</hi> Day it ſelf, all giving thanks to God for having done them the honour to beſtow Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> upon them for their Protectour, whom he had made Guardian to his Son JESUS CHRIST the Word Incarnate.</p>
                     <p>From the conſideration of this Solemnity and Devotion to Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Canada;</hi> let us conſider what we may alſo Practiſe upon the ſame Feaſt; that as they do what they can, to obſerve it with due So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, ſo we may do the like; not ſo much by exteriour Marks of Joy, which are very laudable; but by Exerciſing Interiour Devotion and Fervour in all our Actions; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thereby the Glory of this Saint, and move him to advance us in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for the ſecure obtaining ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Salvation. For if there be a Feaſt in the whole Year, next to thoſe of our Saviour and Bleſſed Lady, in which we may hope for a grant of our Petitions, 'tis this of Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</hi> Since Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> aſſures us in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170805:55"/>the ſixth Chapter of her Life, that whatſoever we aske him upon his Feaſt, ſhall either have a ſucceſsful grant, or be chang'd into a grant of ſomething elſe, more Beneficial for the Soul of the Petitioner.</p>
                     <p>But if you deſire to know more particularly how to ſpend the Day of his Feaſt with Piety and Profit. I will heer ſet down half a dozen Devotions, of which you may take your choice: I ſuppoſe you obſerve the Feaſt of his Eſpouſals, which the Church keeps on the two and twentith Day of <hi>January,</hi> as well as the Feaſt of his Return out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> upon the ſeventeenth of the ſame Month; and the Memory alſo of his Flight into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> upon the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith of <hi>December,</hi> theſe are unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agree'd upon by all; but ſome differ about his chief Feaſt: Which the <hi>Greeks</hi> Celebrate on the ſix and twentith of <hi>December,</hi> the Day after <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> as Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts in his <hi>Martyrologe.</hi> Others obſerve it on the twenty ſixth of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>Mother <hi>Jane</hi> of the <hi>Angels,</hi> of whom I have already ſpoken, beg'd of Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> upon New Years Day, that he wou'd take her for that Year. 1636. into his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and by his powerful Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, obtain of our Saviour the Bleſſing, of being deliver'd from all Interiour or Exteriour Impediments in God's Service; and to diſpoſſeſs her of thoſe Devils that Tormented her; and free her from whatſoever elſe that kept or retarded her Soul, from the Union of his Divine Love. The Night following, as ſhe fell aſleep, ſhe ſeem'd to feel a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Devotion than ordinary, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with a moſt incredible ſweet
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170805:57"/>ſmell, quite different from all other ſcents; that are found in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes of this World. And at the ſame time ſhe heard a Voice that ſayd to her, <hi>Behold him, to whom thou haſt Recommended thy ſelf.</hi> Hereupon the Holy Patriarch Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> came into her mind, and her Heart was fill'd with an extraordinary venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for, and love of him: She ſeem'd in her Sleep to ſee ſuch a dazeling Light, as far exceeded the Brightneſs and Splendor of the Sun: Within which ſhe beheld a Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance full of wonderful Majeſty, ſo Beautiful that ſhe neither found Words to expreſs it, nor any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons whereby to diſcover her Thoughts.</p>
                     <p>After all, the Perſon ſpoke to her as follows: <hi>Conſerve Patience and Conſtancy in theſe Senſible difficulties you ſuffer; ſupport 'em with Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and endeavour to forget your ſelf; for God has Favours in ſtore to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon you. Tell your Exorcist, that if Men labour not for your Recovery, God will make it his own Work. By all means let him continue his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and God by his Miniſtery, will Expel the Devil that moſt of all hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders your Devotions.</hi> This being ſayd all Vaniſh'd, except the Perfume, which laſted ſo ſtrong for ſome time after, that when ſhe awak'd, ſhe verily thought her Chamber had been Perfum'd.</p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:170805:57"/>
                     <p>Her Thoughts were taken up all the Day following with a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our Saviour, and with the Aſſurance, of Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Aſſiſtance, in this extream neceſſity ſhe was then in. Nor was ſhe deceiv'd; for five Days after, upon the Feaſt of the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> ſhe found the effect of her Protectour's Interceſſion, by being diſpoſſeſs'd of that Devil that did ſo maliciouſly interrupt her Devotions. The Father Exorciſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him in the Preſence of all that were Spectatours, that for a Mark of his going out, he ſhou'd write the Name of <hi>Mary</hi> upon her Hand, as he did, tho' not without great difficulty and repugnance; fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Name in very legible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters immediately above Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph's,</hi> which had been writ there before, upon the going out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Devil. which Names, during her whole Life, appear'd as clear and diſtinct as they did the firſt Day; which I my ſelf was an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of, as the ſayd Religious paſt by <hi>Lyons,</hi> to go to <hi>Aneſſy</hi> to viſit the Tomb of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Sales,</hi> in the Year 1638. I ſay nothing of the Names of JESUS and Saint <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> of <hi>Sales,</hi> that were to be ſeen on the back of the ſame Hand, Writ at the Command of the Exorciſt, as a Mark of theſe Devils quitting their Poſſeſſion; which by God's Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170805:58"/>they had taken of her Body, that being not ſo much to my purpoſe; which is only to declare, how much it conduc'd to her Happineſs, to have recourſe to Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> for his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, either upon his own, or upon any other Feaſt.</p>
                     <p>The third Devotion that may be perform'd to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> is to take him for our chief Patron and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, during our whole Life; and Yearly to renew this Reſolution upon his Feaſt. I know a Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our <hi>Society,</hi> who conſtantly practiſes this Devotion every Year, Offering himſelf unto him by the Recital of ſuch a Prayer, as in our Sodalities of our Bleſſed Lady, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in our Colledges, is publickly recited at their Reception into it. I pretend not to perſwade you to perform this Exerciſe every Day, leſt to ſome it might ſeem too great a burthen, but only once a Year, at leaſt upon his chief Feaſt; which his true Clients can not think too much to perform. And the firſt time one makes uſe of this Prayer, 'tis fit to chooſe him for our particular Patron and Protector. The Prayer is ſhort and therefore I ſhall inſert it heer, as I ſhall inſert a longer at the end of this Book, Page, 25. amongſt other particular Devotions to be recited at Leiſure.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>O Holy</hi> Joſeph, <hi>Spouſe of the moſt Bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary. <hi>I</hi> N. N. <hi>chooſe you this Day for my ſpecial Advocate and Patron, and do firmly purpoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to forſake you, nor to ſay, do, nor ſuffer any under my charge, to ſay or do any thing againſt your Honour. I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly therefore beſeech, you that you will pleaſe to take me for your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and conſtant Servant, and to aid and aſſiſt me in all my Actions, eſpecially in the hour of my Death.</hi> Amen.</p>
                     <p>Make a firm Reſolution to keep this Purpoſe, and renew it often, either at Holy Communion, or when you viſit the Bleſſed Sacrament; whereby you will render this Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more Pleaſing to God, more Honorable to the Saint, and more profitable to your ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Devotion may either be to offer Maſs your ſelf, or get a Prieſt to offer one in Honour of Saint <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and that piece of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church Hiſtory, that was found and offer'd to Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the V I. as very authentick, aſſures us, that CHRIST aſſiſting Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> at his Death, gave him his Bleſſing, and Promiſs'd to give the ſame to all thoſe, that ſhou'd offer Sacrifice to God in Honour of Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> upon the Day of his Glorious Death, the ninteenth of <hi>March:</hi> But we have no Sacrifice except the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170805:59"/>of Holy Maſs. And what greater Bleſſing can we have than the Sacrifice of the Son of God, who was Promis'd to us? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over were not this true, yet all that we can perform that is conſiderable, all that is of any worth, or that conduces to the Glory of any Saint, is included in the Oblation of the Divine Sacrifice of Maſs; wherein JESUS CHRIST is offer'd in thanks giving to his Eternal Father, for all thoſe Favours and Benefits he has heap'd upon any Saint, raiſing him to ſo Eminent a Glory and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Devotion is to give Almes, or beſtow a Dinner upon ſome poor Man or Widdow in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and if you pleaſe for the ſame end relieve a poor Woman and her little Infant to Honour the Created Trinity; the Infant JESUS, <hi>Mary,</hi> as alſo Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and to encourage you to ſo Pious a Work, Saint <hi>Vincent Ferrerius</hi> recounts a wonderful Story of a Gentelman of <hi>Valence,</hi> who was very Devout to all theſe three, and amongſt the reſt of his Devotions, us'd every Chriſtmas Day, to invite a Woman with a Sucking Child, and an Old Man to Dine with him; and all this for the Love he bore to <hi>Jeſus, Mary,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph.</hi> This Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Devotion was ſo pleaſing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170805:59"/>to God, that upon his Death Bed, he had the Comfort to ſee them, who juſt as he Departed, gave him this comfortable Invitation to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, as follows. <hi>Friend you have every Year invited us to a Feaſt in your Houſe, come now and we will receive you to our Feaſt, and into the dwelling place of the Bleſſed, there to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The ſixth and laſt Devotion to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> is to meditate upon the Vertues, Myſteries or chief Paſſages of his Life. The Morning either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after Communion, is the moſt proper time for Meditation: Becauſe the After-noon is reſerv'd for Even-Song, Sermon, or ſome other Works of Charity, as viſiting the Sick in Hoſpitals, comforting and relieving Priſoners. How and when theſe Meditations are to be us'd, I ſhall declare in the following chapter.</p>

                     <p>I Cannot think ther's any better means to paſs the Octave of Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> with Devotion and profit, than by the conſideration of his Life and Death; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating upon his Glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Becauſe ſuch Reflexions as theſe, will increaſe our Love and Affection towards him, and move us to earneſt and efficacious attempts to imitate his tranſcendent Vertues. However becauſe ſome may not have time or opportunity of making theſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170805:60"/>Meditations, and that thoſe that have not, or know not how to Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, may make uſe of 'em inſtead of Spiritual Reading; I have made the Meditations ſomewhat longer than ordinary. Which you will find Printed in a large Character at the end of this Book, amongſt other Devotions: Page, 41. There are eight of 'em in all, for each Day of the Octave of his Feaſt, in which are briefly contain'd the chief Paſſages of the Life, Death and Glory of Saint <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and tho' the Reading of 'em for your Spiritual Lecture, will be very profitable, yet they will produce far greater profit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in your Soul, if you Meditate upon 'em; whereby you will increaſe a far greater Devotion to Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> than only by the bare Reading of them.</p>
                     <p>We have declar'd already that all the Devotions, Honours and Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that are render'd to other Saints, ought to be given to Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi> For whoſoever Loves him, as he deſerves, muſt needs think he can never ſufficiently Honour him, his Merits exceeding all Honour and Devotion that can be ſhew'd him. Wherefore ſhou'd I adviſe you to cauſe a Maſs to be ſayd in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to perform ſome good Work of Charity or Pennance, you may ſay I invite you only to ſuch a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170805:61"/>general teſtimony of Affection, as we give to all other Saints whom we honour; I will here therefore propoſe to you ſuch a particular Devotion, as Mother <hi>Jane</hi> of the <hi>Angels,</hi> Superiour of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſulins</hi> practis'd with admirable ſucceſs.

                     <p>You may alſo ſay or get nine Maſſes ſayd in honour of Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> which was a Devotion that very much aſſiſted Father <hi>John Joſeph Sevrin,</hi> Exorciſt to this Religious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; for before he had ended his nine Maſſes, the Devil left her, writing according to his Promiſe his Name, in the preſence of many up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her bare Hand, and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Preſence of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobleman,<note n="†" place="bottom">The Right Honorable <hi>Walter Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Mancheſters</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Containing nine different oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of particular Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions proper to Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> and practis'd by his Particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votes.</head>
                     <p>THE firſt is, when you have loſt any thing, you had a high Value for, to have recourſe to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> either to beg his help, or at leaſt to ſuffer profitably this loſs, if by his Aſſiſtance we happen not to recover it. <hi>John Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> his great Client ſuggeſts this Devotion; aſſuring us, that ſuch as in theſe occaſions recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this great Patriarch, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently either recover what is loſt, or by his efficacious Aſſiſtance, even gain by their loſs, bearing the ſame with perfect Patience and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170805:63"/>For a proof of what he aſſerts, he brings for an Example the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which one of his acquaintance receiv'd, who loſt ſomething of great Value; and recover'd it by this means. 'Tis perhaps upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that Scrupulous and Anxious Perſons have recourſe to him, ſince they have loſt ſo great a Jewel, as is the Repoſe of Conſcience, and Peace of Mind; this being the deareſt, moſt precious; and conſiderable Treaſure we have in this World; for we may aſſure our ſelves, and certainly believe, that he who felt the loſs of JESUS and the grief it coſt him, will not fail to comfort thoſe who implore his aſſiſtance in, the like exigency.</p>
                     <p>The Second is, to take occaſion for Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> ſake, to make it your endeavour to Love all his Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and Devotes, whether they be already gon before us to Heaven, or are ſtill with us upon Earth; and eſpecially thoſe who have born the happy Name of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> but above all to ſhew a particular Love and Devotion to Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and as I may ſay his chief Devote; and not only to thoſe, that are in Heaven, but alſo to thoſe as you know particularly to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to him upon Earth. For your Love to them upon this account, will become no leſs pleaſing to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170805:63"/>Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> than if they bore his Name; and the bearing a tenderneſs and love to thoſe that do ſo, is very pleaſing alſo to Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Wherefore to help you to practiſe this Devotion, I will here give you a 'Liſt of ſome Eminent Perſons that have born his Name, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account receiv'd from God ſome of thoſe particular Favours he beſtow'd upon him. And ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the Patriarch <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who tho' he liv'd ſo many Ages before our great Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> yet was a Type of him, and probably upon that account might receive his Name and thoſe other extraordinary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours God beſtow'd upon him.</p>
                     <p>The firſt therefore in this Liſt of thoſe that bore the Name of <hi>Joſeph:</hi> Is the Patriarch <hi>Joſeph</hi> of the Old Law, to whom the Holy Ghoſt gives a evry great Elogium or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation in the 49. Chapter of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticus.</hi> Calling him, <hi>Ruler and Prince of his Brethren, the Stay and Support of his Nation and People.</hi> Who deſerves alſo the firſt place, he being not only the firſt to whom this Name was given, but who was alſo a Type of our Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Chaſtity. The Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter alſo that the Holy Ghoſt gives the Patriarch, agrees with our <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> in a far more eminent degree than it did to the Patriarch; he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170805:64"/>being a Prince and Ruler not only over his Brethren, but Governour to the Mother and Son of God, being their ſupport in all their Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Saving him who was to Save not only one, but all Nations throu'out the whole World.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> that Noble <hi>Centurion</hi> prais'd by the Holy Ghoſt for his Love to CHRIST in a time of extream danger. For when thoſe who were Friends of CHRIST fled from him, as being look'd upon as Enemies to the State; he couragiouſly ask'd his Body, and took care of Embalming it, and laying it in a new Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had prepar'd for himſelf; by the Love and care he took of it after his Death, hereby Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Love to the Living Body of JESUS.

                     <p>The tenth is Father <hi>Joſeph Anchieth</hi> of the SOCIETY of JESUS ſtil'd the Apoſtle of <hi>Braſil,</hi> as Saint <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verius</hi> is ſtil'd Apoſtle of the <hi>Indies.</hi> Who upon account of the many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles he wrought, may alſo be ſtil'd: <hi>Moyſes</hi> of the ſayd SOCIETY, working 'em in all kinds, and upon all occaſions.

Nay he commanded Birds, Beaſts and even all the Elements, after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if he had had a full Empire and Dominion over all Creatures; as you may Read in his Life, which you will find full of wonders.</p>
                     <p>Behold here ten <hi>Joſeph's</hi> worthy to be honour'd, no leſs for their Vertue, than out of Love to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whoſe Name they bear; and who deſerves that in conſideration of his worth, we ſhou'd ſet a high eſteem upon any one that has any Relation to him, either by bearing his Name, or by Imitating his Vertues;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170805:67"/>and therefore I ſhall end this Piece of Devotion I recommended to you, by recounting what I receiv'd few Months ago from the Mouth of a very Faithful Servant of God, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Woman of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and a great Devote of Saint <hi>Joſeph's.</hi> Who told me ſhe was wont to Pray often, and to Recmmend her ſelf to the Glorious <hi>Joſeph</hi> in Heaven; and ſhe aſſur'd me, that ſhe found very great Help and Comfort from this Deyotion, for they by their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion obtain'd for her, what ſhe deſir'd 'em to help her in.</p>
                     <p>The third particular Devotion we may ſhew to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> is to take all occaſions to honour his Name. Firſt, by giving the Name of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> in Baptiſme, Confirmation, or Entrance into Religion, to any one who ſhall have any Dependance upon us, or by taking it our ſelves in the two laſt occaſions. We have an Example of this Devotion, in out Bleſſed Ladies giving it to Bleſſed <hi>Berman,</hi> which I juſt now related; and God be prais'd 'tis in this Age a very frequent Devotion; for both ſeculars as well as Religious, covet to bear this Name; and that with a great deal of reaſon; ſince Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians are forc'd to own, that their Sorceries have not that power upon any Infants that are Nam'd <hi>Joſeph;</hi> as upon others. For the proof of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170805:68"/>which a Perſon of Honour, who had loſt all his Children by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, a few Days after their Birth, being Councel'd (by one who had once ſtudied that wicked Art more than he ought to have done) to give his next Child the Name of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> aſſuring him to his own knowledge, it was ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all Witchcraft; he follow'd his Priends Advice, and found his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy very Powerful; for his next Child Liv'd to inherit both his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to Conſecrate Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In the Order of Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is commonly practis'd, and our Saviour himſelf, gave the Name of <hi>Joſeph</hi> to the Monaſtery of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vila.</hi> Father <hi>Francis Canilec</hi> one of our SOCIETY, no leſs renoun'd for his Vertue, than his Noble Birth, Founded the Houſe in <hi>Bell-Court</hi> at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and gave it the Name of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> to teſtifie his Affection to the Spouſe of the Virgin Mother of God. And his Example gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſeveral Years after to Father <hi>Cotton,</hi> to give the ſame Name to the Church he there built; ſo that whatſoever we poſſeſt in that place, might be under the Protection of Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, By frequent pronouncing or repeating the Name of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as <hi>Gaſpar Bond,</hi> that good <hi>Minim</hi> was wont to do, of whom I have made mention, <hi>Page,</hi> 63. This Devotion is very eaſie, if we do but take the the pleaſure he took, in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing theſe three Holy Names of <hi>Jeſus, Maria, Joſeph.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, To wear Rings in which the Name of <hi>Joſeph</hi> is ingraven, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by it ſelf, or with the other two Names, <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to this Devotion, when the great Plague caus'd a very great Deſtruction at <hi>Lyons,</hi> I knew many that wore ſuch ingrav'd Rings for this Intention, that Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> would protect them from the Infection, and with ſo great a ſucceſs, that not ſo much as one of the Family of thoſe that wore them, or of the Houſe where they lodg'd, Were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; God giving ſo great a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to this ſmall Devotion.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, To begin our chief Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under the auſpicious favour of his Name, as the Governour of <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> did, at the Dedication of the Church of <hi>Kebeck</hi> in new <hi>France</hi> 1637. before which he planted a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard with a triple Crown and Wreaths, with Scutcheons, in which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Capitals theſe three Names, JESUS, MARIA, JOSEPH, which Standard was no ſooner erected, but
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170805:69"/>it was ſaluted by the Souldiers with a Volly of Musket ſhot.</p>
                     <p>The fourth particular Devotion to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> is to imitate Saint <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa's</hi> Love, to her Good Father as ſhe ſtill'd him, by taking occaſion to invite others to become his Clients, and omitting nothing that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to his Honour and Glory; which is ſo grateful a Devotion to the Bleſſed Virgin alſo, that ſhe gave thanks to Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> for having contributed and incited Perſons to this Devotion towards her Spouſe all over the Church, eſpecially throu-out all <hi>Europe.</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>John Gerſon</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> alſo imitated; for what did he not do in this Point? He Compos'd an Office and Maſs for his Feaſt. He writ to ſeveral Biſhops to induce them to order his Feaſt to be Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in their Biſhopricks with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and Solemnity, as a Feaſt of Obligation, and by their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to move the People to obſerve it. His ordinary Converſations and Entertainments of thoſe that Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, him, were upon this Subject. Moreover thoſe who liſt themſelves in the Confraternity of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and by their Piety and Examples move others to the like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, do hereby alſo Imitate Saint <hi>Tereſa,</hi> and the Pious Ghancelour's Devotion towards him.</p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:170805:69"/>
                     <p>The fifth, is frequently to take occaſion to thank Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> for the Labour and Pains he took for <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Services he did for them; for how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. ſays Saint <hi>Tereſa,</hi> to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what the Queen of Heaven and her little Infant ſuffer'd upon Earth, without giving thanks to Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> for his Charitable Aſſiſtance in their Sufferings. The thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of thoſe Paſſages of Charity he Exercis'd; as even the bearing JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS in his Arms, his helping his Spouſe to dreſs him, his laying him in his Cradle, and ſuch like ordinary Actions as theſe, tho they ſeem but ſmall and inconſiderable; yet 'tis not to be imagin'd what tender Affections the conſideration of them breeds in our Hearts; and how they move us to Exerciſe greater Services to JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, and alſo a Love to Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> who hereby expreſs'd his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth Particular Devotion we may Exerciſe towards Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> is to take occaſion when any Affairs of Importance happen, to addreſs our ſeles to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and wholly commit them to his Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. 'Tis alſo a good Devotion, frequently to aske him Bleſſing, and to repoſe a Confidence in him as in a Father; beſeeching him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>To theſe I may ad ſome other Devotions. I know ſome Perſons are wont to Exerciſe. Some in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities ſay a little Pair of Beads in his honour, ſee the manner of ſaying them <hi>Page.</hi> 28. amongſt the Devotions to this Saint. Others ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deny any thing ask'd them, in the Name and for the ſake of Saint <hi>Joſeph;</hi> but I ſhou'd be too tedious; ſhou'd I ſet down all the Dovotions, that the Affections of his Clients ſuggeſt to them; what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſayd, is ſufficient; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be done to other Saints, either by Prayers, Vows, or any other Reſpects, that and much more may be done to him.

                     <p>TO give you a ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the care Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> takes to render his Clients Interiour and Spiritual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; I muſt firſt declare to you what is meant by Interiour Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and in what this Spiritual and Interiour Life do's conſiſt; There being very few Perſons who Solidly attend thereunto; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is great need of ſo ſolid
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170805:71"/>and Powerful an Aſſiſtance for the obtaining it, as Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> gives his Devout Clients.</p>
                     <p>An Interiour and Spiritual Life therefore, is that which minds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Perfection; and which reſts in the Vertuous Actions of the Soul, practiſing the inward Acts of all Vertues; namely of Faith, Hope, Charity, Religion, Adoration, Thankſgiving, Humiliation, with a good, perfect and ſincere Intention, without any mixture of Carnal ends. And in the performance of all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour and Corporal Actions, with an Interiour Spirit and Preſence of Mind; Beholding God Preſent, and being carried with a tender Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards him, whilſt we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the outward Action we are about.</p>
                     <p>This is what is call'd a Spiritual and Interiour Life; and is ſo call'd becauſe it conſiſts not in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour or Corporal Action, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it Acts Interiourly in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Soul, and within the Spirit or Mind only; and 'tis this we muſt begin withall, and what is thus begun in Spirit, muſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards paſs to our Exteriour Actions, which are but of very ſmall Value, if not accompanied with this Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Life and Vertue; there being no compariſon between the inward and outward Actions; and if we
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170805:72"/>work not by this Interiour Spirit and Purity of Intention, all the pains we take are loſt; we labour much and gain little or nothing, how great things ſoever in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we may perform: But work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after this manner we gain and heap up Everlaſting Treaſures, with ſo much profit and advantage, that even the leaſt Action wonderfully advances and increaſes our Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and gains a great degree of Glory in Heaven. This caus'd Saint <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> of <hi>Pazzi,</hi> after that the Glory of Bleſſed <hi>Aloyſius Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga</hi> was reveal'd to her, to ſay he had gain'd that Sublime Glory, by his Interiour Actions; in which lys all the Perfection of the Soul. So that this Interiour, and this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life, is one and the ſelf ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis not ſo eaſie, as one may conceive, to enter into this Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and Inward Life, or to lead ſuch a Spiritual Life as I ſpeak of: Since to be much recollected, and to enter into our ſelves, is the way to become a Perfect Interiour Man: And to do this you muſt caſt off and wean your ſelf from all atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Creatures, you muſt lay aſide Intereſt, and Human Reſpects, ſuch as are, Gain, Honour, Fleſh and Blood; you muſt give your ſelf to Recollection and Prayer, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170805:72"/>hereby unite your ſelf to God. To do this you muſt conſtantly walk in the Preſence of God, ſeek no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his Divine Will, Subdue your own Paſſions, and then practiſe all ſorts of Vertues, belonging to the Interiour Powers of your Soul. But all this is very hard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and from hence it follows, that very few Perſons attain to it; and for this reaſon a great Maſter of Spirit ſayd very well;<note n="†" place="bottom">Perfectio eſt Paucorum.</note> 
                        <hi>Few are Perfect.</hi> But on the contrary the Imperfect and Extroverted Perſons are very many, who permit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſinke into the Paſſionate Affection of ſelf Love, give their Will the Reines, and yeild to all that ſenſe requires, languiſhing in Senſuality, rather than practiſing true Vertue, of whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> complains; <hi>All ſeek their own, or themſelves, not</hi> JESUS <hi>or the things that belong to him.</hi> But care muſt be taken, by thoſe who liſt themſelves Clients to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that they do not too ſoon and too eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themſelves to have obtain'd, this Interiour and Spiritual Life; becauſe they find ſome ſenſible feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Devotion:<note n="*" place="bottom">Omnes quae ſua ſunt quaerunt non quae JESUS CHRISTI <hi>ad Philip.</hi> 2.21.</note> But when they

                     <p>This Siſter coming to her and expreſſing how great a deſire ſhe had of the Spiritual Advancement of the Monaſtery, and in order thereunto told her that ſhe had obſerv'd ſome Imperfections in certain of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; which gave Diſedification. Telling her that ſuch and ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were guilty of them. The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour took in good part this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſment ſhe gave her, and with her wonted Sweetneſs, promis'd in time to redreſs 'em, and provide a ſeaſonable cure. But this Religious being of the Number of thoſe, who wou'd Reform all at once, and who thought her ſelf far from wanting any ſuch Reform, unſatisfi'd with this Sweet Anſwer of her Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, told her that a ſpeedy Order ought to be taken, and ſo efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a one, as might keep the Evil from ſpreading; and ſhe knew none
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170805:73"/>better, than to devide the Monaſtery, and that all who were Stubborn and of an Ill Cholerick Humour, Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh in Rieſing, Tepid, Contentious and Imperfect, ſhou'd go by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into another Houſe; and the other part of the Community, that is the Good, Fervent, Perfect and Affable, that had made progreſs in Vertue, practis'd Mortification, and were exact obſervers of Religious Diſcipline, ſhou'd remain in this.</p>
                     <p>The good Mother ſtill Patiently gave ear to all ſhe ſayd, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ask'd her, when ſhe had ended her Diſcourſe, which of theſe ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to be in? Amongſt thoſe that are Perfect, reply'd the Religious, that I may have no trouble nor vexation of Mind, to hinder me in Vertue. And I, reply'd the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, will accompany the leſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; firſt, becauſe I am one of their number, and alſo out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to them, that by having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſhewing Sweetneſs and Patience towards 'em, I may gain 'em, and have a greater ſubject of Merit. When the Siſter heard this admirable Reply from her Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſhe was ſilenc'd, and ſaw how much ſhe was deceiv'd by thinking her ſelf one of the more Perfect; and moreover ſaw that there being not many ſuch, the Monaſtery being ſlenderly furniſh'd with Subjects,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170805:74"/>there wou'd ſcarce have been half a doſen left in the whole Houſe. For in effect in a Community of threeſcore Religious, you will ſcarce find ſix true Interiour Perſons, and amongſt a hundred Religious Men, or five hundred Seculars, it wou'd be hard to find ten ſuch as we ſpeak of, who are eminent in this Interiour Life, and make the ſeeking after Perfection their chief En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour.</p>

What a Comfort is it then, to have ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful an Aſſiſtant who ſweetens all Difficulties, lending us his efficacious Hand; whereby he manifeſts that God has left to his ſole care, the bringing up of all thoſe, who effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly deſire to become eminent in this hidden Interiour Life, as a Recompence of that Interiour hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Life he led himſelf at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> with his Sacred Family; and that he is the Ruler and Governour of thoſe Souls, who deſire to have their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Actions conceal'd to the World, and only known to God.

                        </gap> 'twas God's Will to take him for her Directour in this her Solitude.</p>
                     <p>Some time after God gave her a ſtrong inpulſe to make choice of ſome Saint, that might for her Life time, take care of her Interiour; hereupon ſhe thought of chooſing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170805:75"/>ſome of thoſe Saints, for whom, from her tender Years, ſhe had had a Devotion. Nevertheleſs it came into her Mind to put Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> amongſt the reſt: After ſhe had well mingl'd the Papers or Suffrages, Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as before, twice fell to her Lot; however tho' 't was very pleaſing to her, that ſhe had thus drawn him; yet ſhe beg's of God, that ſhe might moſt certainly know his Divine Will, to permit her if it were his Divine Pleaſure, to light upon the ſame Lot the third time; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mingling 'em again, the firſt that came to her Hand was Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which ſucceſs made her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely acknowledge, and receive him for her Spiritual Father, Protectour, and faithful Directour, of her Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Religious Life.</p>
                     <p>But to give us ſtill a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to chooſe him for our Maſter and Directour in this Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Life. Not only Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> Councel'd all who deſir'd to profit in Prayer, and in this Spiritual kind of Interiour Life, to have recourſe to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and take him for their Maſter. But alſo his Virgin Spouſe the Mother of God, who knows his Power and Goodneſs, gave the ſame Counſel to a Religious Perſon, who upon account of her Name and that of her Order, had a Filial Affection for her, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170805:76"/>and Tender Devotion to her. This Religious being very much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted for ſome Temptations, ſhe ſuffer'd, eſpecially in time of Prayer, they giving her a great deal of trouble and diſincouragement, upon account, that they made her think ſhe ſhould never be able to treat with God with that Fervour, nor have ſo open and liberal a Heart towards his Divine Majeſty as ſhe earneſtly deſir'd, and found neceſſary perfectly to ſerve him. Hereupon ſhe addreſſes her ſelf to the Bleſſed Virgin as to her tender Mother, and Affectionately tells her with a Filial Confidence, that ſhe muſt needs obtain for her this Liberty of Spirit, and Inſpire and Direct her what Saint ſhe ſhou'd chooſe to help her herein; and in whoſe Aſſiſtance ſhe might ſecurely Confide; that ſhe might expreſs her Gratitude during her whole Life, for obtaining by her Aſſiſtance ſo great a Benefit: She had no ſooner ended her Petition, but ſhe obtain'd a grant thereof; for ſhe found that Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> was very lively preſented to her Mind, and with a great Interiour Sweetneſs; and the Excellency and great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this Saint was ſo clearly ſet before her, that ſhe retain'd the idea thereof during her whole Life; and ever after Confided in him, in all and for all, as in a Loving Father;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170805:76"/>who immediately free'd her from the pain ſhe was in, not only for the preſent, but for the future; and when at any time any of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Temptations return'd, ſhe found no diſquiet at all, nor did ſhe do any thing elſe, but confidently caſt her ſelf into the tender Arms of her Dear Father, and immediately ſhe found her wonted calm and Peace of Mind, accompanied with a moſt comfortable Union and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment with God.</p>
                     <p>Having thus ſt own you, how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> takes upon him to help Souls to lead this Spiritual and Interiour Life, I ſhall declare to you the manner how he do's it, and the helps he gives towards the gaining this Interiour Perfection; by procuring thoſe things that are requir'd for it, and conduce to it, ſuch as are Prayer, Preſence of God, Peace of the Mind, and the Interiour Practice of all ſorts of Vertue.</p>
                     <p>As for Prayer, Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> aſſures us in her Life, that he who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find a Maſter to teach him how to Pray, muſt chooſe Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> for his Guid and Directour; and he will certainly find out the way to perform this Exerciſe well.</p>
                     <p>To Confirm this; I know two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who found great difficulty in Prayer, the one by frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending himſelf to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:170805:77"/>the other by undertaking the Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of a few Prayers in his Honour, found themſelves aſſiſted by him, even as ſoon as they had perform'd theſe Devotions; and they have ſince by his Interceſſion obtain'd ſo great a facility in Mental Prayer, that there is no greater Comfort or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to them, than the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>A Religious Perſon of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance being newly Profeſt in a Holy Order, deſiring very earneſtly, as ſhe told me, the gift of quiet Prayer, and to be free'd from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, found her ſelf inwardly mov'd to have recourſe to this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Maſter; to whom ſhe moſt readily adreſs'd her ſelf, and did it with ſuch a Confidence in his help, that he obtain'd this gift for her. And ſhe moreover owns, that when ſhe Meditates upon any Point of Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Vertues and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ther's nothing elſe to be thought on, but what ordinary happens in the Meditations of the Bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the Bleſſed Sacrament, and ſuch like high Myſteries, Acts of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, Submiſſion, entring into her own nothingneſs, and Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo high and ſublime a greatneſs.</p>
                     <p>But the other favours ſhe receiv'd of this Saint, by means of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending her ſelf to him, are equal
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170805:77"/>to theſe already related. When ſhe go's to Bed ſhe beg's ſomthing ſhe wants and receives it, ſhe deſires to be freed from Impure Dreams, he obtains for her this Petition alſo. So happy a thing it is to have ſo powerfull a Maſter and ſo good a Father.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the Preſence of God another thing conducing to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Life, 'tis this that he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly obtains for his Children and Devout Clients.</p>
                     <p>I knew ſome who continually walk'd in the Preſence of God, wherby they were guided in all, even their leaſt Actions, with very great Atention, yet without the leaſt let or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>THE Viſion Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> had upon the Aſſumption of our Bleſſed Lady, whilſt ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd the Sins of her Paſt Life; is a proof of Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> help, in all our Spiritual Infirmities; At which time a Divine Tranſport ſeizing her Soul, ſhe ſaw it cloath'd with a very white and reſplendent Robe. At firſt ſhe perceiv'd not who put it on, but at laſt ſhe ſaw the Mother of God on the one ſide of her, and Saint. <hi>Joſeph</hi> on the other, and underſtood that this was done by them, to ſignifie that at the ſame
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170805:79"/>time her Soul was freed from all Sin and Imperfection. Which proves how careful and deſirous the Holy Spouſe of <hi>Mary</hi> is, to diſperſe and drive away all Spiritual Diſtempers, and reſtore Purity to our Soul; ſo that in all attack's of any Violent Paſſion; in any dangerous Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in our failings or fall's into any Imperfection; there is no better means to free our ſelves, and obtain a particular help and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, than by calling upon Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſee daily Examples of this by the great and wonderful change we find in the Converſations of thoſe, who are noted for their Devotion to this Saint; what Victories do we perceive they have gain'd over their Paſſions? What Mortifications do they not uſe to ſubdue their Senſes? And with what Peace and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity do they perform all this?

                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:170805:81"/>who Daily upon his Knees he was wont to recite before his Image, ſeveral Devotions in his Honour. This Perſon lying dangerouſly Sick, without thinking, as he ſhou'd have done, of a Penitent Confeſſion; his cares being rather taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Health of his Body, than that of his Soul. Being in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> mindfull of his paſt Devotions to him, ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a true Friend and Father to his Soul; by Appearing to him, and warning him to make a good and ſpeedy Confeſſion, and to prepare himſelf for Death, which was neerer him than he imagin'd; he follow'd his Councel, put himſelf in a good State, Receiv'd the laſt Sacraments, and aſſiſted by Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> in his laſt Agony, made a moſt happy End, and Receiv'd hereby a Reward for his conſtant Devotions to this Saint.</p>
                     <p>Another Example of later Date, I receiv'd from the Teſtimony of Perſons moſt worthy of Credit. A Father of the SOCIETY, being deſir'd earneſtly by ſome Friends to ſay a Maſs; and another of the ſame SOCIETY not Prieſt, to Offer nine Communions in Honour of Saint <hi>Joſeph;</hi> that by his powerful Interceſſion a neer Kins-Man of theirs might be drawn from a Wicked Licentious Life, in which he had been ſo Miſerably plung'd for the

                        </gap>ou'd prevail with him to Live even like a Man of Honour before Men, as became his Quality; much leſs like a Chriſtian before God, as his Sacred Character and Habit alſo he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

At the ſelf ſame time theſe Prayers were Offer'd for this Perſon, he fell grieviouſly Sick, as his Relation had deſir'd he might, in caſe no other means wou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him; and ſo it fell out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wiſh; the Diſtemper increas'd to ſuch an Extremity, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he Receiv'd the laſt Sacraments, and then Miraculouſly Recover'd; with a Reſolution hereafter to imploy his time and all his endeavours in a Work of great Importance to God's Glory. Which he Faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, to the great Edification and Comfort of all that knew him; who were witneſs of this great change wrought by Saint <hi>Joſeph.</hi> This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion happen'd at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another no leſs ſtrange Converſion than this happen'd at <hi>Lyons,</hi> where a Young Man of very good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, who had paſs'd his Youth in the Fear of God, and infine was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to quit the World, and intirely give himſelf to God's Service, for the greater ſecurity of his Salvation. But this deſign not pleaſing his Parents, they endeavour'd to devert
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170805:82"/>him from it, but very unhappily; for he now ſeeing himſelf Fruſtrated of his deſign of executing his good Deſires, his former ſervour cooling by little and little, he fell from a Remiſneſs in his Devotions, to an intire neglect of them; at laſt he quite loos'd the Rains of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and gave himſelf up to all ſhameful Liberties. Then he betakes himſelf to the War, where he exerciſes all the Licentiouſneſs of a Souldiers Life. So that there was no Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief or Exceſs, in which he was not the Ringleader. In the mean time his Father and Mother Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their great Fault, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Senſe of Piety and of God's Honour and Glory, fell into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolable Regrets and Afflictions of Mind, acknowledging their Errour, and never giving over by Letters and Good Counſels, both by them ſelves and Friends, to perſwade him to quit his Irregularities; but all in vain, his Heart being harden'd and become obſtinate. At length, as their laſt Refuge, they have recourſe to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> daily beſeeching him to reclaim and bring back this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal Child, by taking him under his Protection. The third day they had earneſtly Offer'd theſe daily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, the Young Man return'd home, caſt himſelf at his Parents Feet, beg'd their Pardon for his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170805:82"/>follies, began a new Life, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded to his former Vocation, by entring into Religion; in which God Rewarded him with Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; all which Favours he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Interceſſion.</p>
                     <p>We have in our Church in <hi>Lyons</hi> a Votive Picture of a Woman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly afflicted for the Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries of her Husband, no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for Reclaiming him prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſhe had Recourſe to Saint <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> making a Vow to him, for the obtaining her Husbands Converſion, which ſhe had no ſooner perform'd, but, her Husbands Thoughts were quite chang'd, and he was never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Diſloyal to his Conſort.</p>
                     <p>A Perſon of Worth and Confident Friend of mine, writ to me a little while ago, knowing I had a Piece of Work in Hand in honour of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> aſſuring me, that Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> had Deliver'd her from a moſt miſerable ſlavery and thraldom of Mind, which happen'd to her after the following manner. She having fail'd in a matter of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, even againſt a Vow made to God, cou'd not bring her ſelf to a plain and clear Confeſſion of her Fault; finding this great difficulty and repugnance, ſhe fully reſolv'd to overcome ſo dangerous a Baſhfulneſs, and for this end that ſhe might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Grace of God, to put her Soul in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170805:83"/>a good State, for nine Days together ſhe ſayd the Hymn and Prayer of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Printed at the end of this Book; <hi>Page.</hi> 20. and upon the ninth Day, ſhe felt a ſtrange Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe for her Offence, found a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Courage to declare all, and to make a good Confeſſion, which ſhe perform'd with a very great Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and a firm purpoſe of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ever after reſolv'd to carry about her an Image of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> even in the Night, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her from bad Dreams, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe acknowledges to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd very ſingular help and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>

                     <p>This is what ſhe her ſelf Recounts, now ſee what follow'd. ſhe finding her ſelf very well, ris out of her Bed, which ſhe had kept upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her Feaver, for fourteen Days together, occaſion'd by a form'd Pluriſie that gave her extraordinary pain; ſhe had been let Blood nine times in twelve Days ſpace, which caus'd ſuch a Weakneſs and Feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as ſhe was ſcarce able to turn her ſelf in her Bed, none expecting any thing but Death. But Mr. <hi>Faveon</hi> her Phyſitian and a Proteſtant was moſt of all aſtoniſh'd, when entring into her Chamber, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of the Miracle, he ſaw all the Company on their Knees, the Sick Womans bed empty and cover'd, and ſaw her, who but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before he had left as a Dying Perſon, riſeing from her Knees, walking in her Religious Habit about the Chamber without any help, and coming towards him with a Smiling Countenance: To whom ſhe recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Miraculous recovery, give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him alſo thanks for the Pains he had taken. This ſurpriſe was ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, that he remaind for along time in a ſilent aſtoniſhment, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to ſay or think, but in the end coming to himſelf, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd it to be a wonderful change, but God ſays he is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent.</p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:170805:85"/>
                     <p>But another, yet greater Miracle ſoon follow'd this; of which this was partly the occaſion; for the reſt of the Oyntment, remaining upon a Linnen Cloath, wherewith the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd Perſon wip'd the Place Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> had Anoynted, not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Sweet and Aromatick Smel, as I my ſelf experienc'd, as this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Perſon, ſo Miraculouſly Cur'd, paſt by <hi>Lyons,</hi> but has alſo the power of Working Miracles, which it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Communicates to Beads, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, Images and Papers that have only touch'd this Miraculous Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the Cloath that Wip'd it off the Religious Perſons Side.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Miracle wrought by the Oyntment is as follows. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame. de <hi>Laubougemont,</hi> about eight Days after Siſter <hi>Jean</hi> of the <hi>Angels</hi> had ſo Miraculouſly Recover'd, being big with Child, happen'd after the ſelf ſame manner to fall Sick of a Pluriſy at <hi>Trevoux,</hi> which four of the ableſt Phyſicians of that place judg'd Incurable, and therefore thought it in vain to apply any Remedies. But God Inſpir'd both the Patient and her Husband to make uſe of the Remedy, Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> had afforded the foreſaid Religious; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſent an Expreſs to <hi>Loudun</hi> to deſire they might make uſe of the Cloath that had Wiped off the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Balſome, from the Place Saint
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170805:86"/>
                        <hi>Joſeph</hi> had Anointed. This being brought to the Sick Lady the very Smel of it's Divine Perfume, fill'd her Soul with Joy, and the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it to her Right Side per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recover'd her, and a few how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers after ſhe was Deliver'd of a Child, which the Doctours and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons judg'd to have been a whole Month Dead in her Body.</p>
                     <p>A Young Man call'd <hi>Claud Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> at <hi>Laubougemont,</hi> afflicted with an extraordinary ſwelling in one of his Ribs, that reach'd quite to his Reins, and caus'd a very violent Feaver: So that all concluded he wou'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a Cripple as long as he liv'd, or elſe the breaking of the Ulſer wou'd occoſion his Death, ſuch an abundance of humours being gather'd together, and had caus'd ſo great an inflamation and ſwelling, as gave him a very great deal of pain; ſo that he cou'd not lye in any other Poſture in his Bed, but upon his Belly. Which mov'd a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in thoſe that viſited him, amongſt which was one of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, a Father of the SOCIETY, from whom I receiv'd this account. Who hearing the Doctours and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons of <hi>Maſcon</hi> conclude there was no hopes of a Cure, caus'd the Youth with all Confidence to make a Vow to Saint <hi>Joſeph:</hi> The Father ſayd Maſs in honour of the ſame Saint,

This done he caus'd the Name of JESUS to be written and brought to the Sick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſwallow'd down the Paper, it having touch'd the Heavenly Balme of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> I before ſpoke of; they rubb'd alſo the inflamation with a piece of the ſame Paper. The ſame Day the Feaver left him, his appetite return'd, the ſwelling waſted by degrees, and his ſtrength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd after ſuch a manner, that within three or four Days he found himſelf able to perform a journey of ſeven Leagues on Hors-back, and this happen'd not only to theſe Perſons I have Nam'd, but to ſeveral others both at <hi>Lyons, Trevoux</hi> and <hi>Loudun</hi> were cur'd of very Deſperate Feavers by the ſame means.</p>
                     <p>Siſter <hi>Margaret Rigaud</hi> a Profeſs'd Religious of the Monaſtery of Saint <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at <hi>Lyons,</hi> fell from a flore one ſtory high, the fall caus'd ſuch a bruiſe in her Head, as made the Blood guſh out of her Ears, and depriv'd her of her Senſes; they us'd all remedies, but nothing cou'd eaſe her Head, which was ſo bruis'd, that for ſeveral Months together ſhe was not able ſo much as to lean, or reſt it even upon the ſofteſt Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Her Mind was in no leſs pain, being very much diſquieted; caus'd
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170805:87"/>by the weakneſs of her offended Brain; and the Evil very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, a Conſult of Doctours and Surgeons were call'd, who all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that her Head was to be open'd by being Trapan'd, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this Remedy were us'd, ſhe wou'd ſoon be depriv'd either of Life or at leaſt of her Senſes. At the Patients requeſt, who extreamly apprehended this Violent Operation, it's execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was defer'd, and in the mean time the Superiour of the Monaſtery by God's Inſpiration, took a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſution to apply another Remedy which had it's effect: She order'd that a Communion for nine Days together, ſhou'd be Offer'd for the Recovery of this Religious, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> thereby to obtain his Interceſſion; the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper notwithſtanding continu'd very Violent, and caus'd great and ſharpe pain to the Patient, during eight Days, and the ninth Day being begun without an appearance of Health, ſome of the Religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd that the Sick Perſon ſhou'd make a Vow to Saint <hi>Antoline,</hi> who was wont by her Interceſſion to Cure ſuch kind of Diſtempers. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religious hearing this, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling that any but Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhou'd have the honour of this Cure, addreſſes her ſelf to him, with a great deal of Fervour begging
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170805:87"/>of him that he wou'd take to himſelf the honour of this Cure, whoſe honour was now at ſtake, ſhe being firſt recommended to him, and that he wou'd not permit another to deprive him of it; eſpecially ſince he had full power to effect it; and laſt of all ſhe conjures him by thoſe Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Prerogatives of his being the reputed Father of JESUS, and Spouſe of <hi>Mary,</hi> to aſſiſt rhe Sick Perſon, Promiſing him if he did ſo, that in thanksgiving, ſhe wou'd perform nine Mortifications, and ſay nine times his Prayer in his honour, but whilſt ſhe Offer'd theſe Devotions in behalf of her Sick Siſter, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring of the ninth Day, ſhe was ſuddenly Cur'd, and ſo perfectly well, that ſhe cou'd not contain her ſelf from running about the Houſe, and crying out a Miracle a Miracle, I am quite recover'd, I am perfectly well again, and ſo ſhe was indeed; for ſhe not only receiv'd health of Body but of Soul alſo; enjoying ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a continual Peace and Repoſe of mind; a Love of Devotion and regular Obſervances; whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was a Mortification to her to be at the Quire, and Plainſong was inſupportable to her; whereas now ſhe is, the moſt Punctual and Zealous obſerver of this Duty, and takes a moſt particular Satisfaction therein, and in exactly following
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170805:88"/>the Community in all other Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Obſervances: Having receiv'd ſo great Light from Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> as to ſee and value Perfection, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tends to it, even before her Corporal Health or any other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction whatſoever; and therefore Honours him as her cheif Patron, ſince together with the Health of her Body, he beſtow'd upon her ſuch Interiour Bleſſings, and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to her Soul.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame Monaſtery about eight Years ago, a Religious newly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, was taken with ſo violent an Headach, that ſhe cou'd take no reſt at all, and Prayer even became impoſſible to her to perform; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon her Superiour, orders her to Communicate nine Tuesdays follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in honour of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to obtain his Interceſſion, for her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery from this Violent Diſtemper; upon the fourth Tuesday, which that Year happen'd to be the Feaſt of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in time of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which was made in their Church in honour of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in which his Prayſes were ſet fourth, her Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſo redubl'd, that ſhe was ſcarce able to hold up her Head, and ſcarce knew even where ſhe was, or what ſhe did.

In the mean time the Sick Youth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſited by the Plague Surgeons, who gave him over for Dead, was taken out of the Houſe, and carri'd to Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> the Peſt-Houſe, for fear of Infecting others; where he found himſelf perfectly well, nor were any more of his Family In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, which were nine in number, whereupon he perform'd his Vow,

Thus he aſſiſted Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> in the Foundation of the greateſt part of her Monaſteries; as is ſet down at large in the Hiſtory of her Order. And I know a perſon who was in great pain about the ſucceſs of an affair of importance, whereupon he caus'd Maſs to be ſayd in honour of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> beg'd his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and it ſucceeded as well as be cou'd wiſh it ſhou'd have done.</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> alſo has concern not

                     <p>The <hi>Carthuſians</hi> alſo experienc'd in the laſt Age, how powerful his Interceſſion is with Almighty God; for fearing ſo great a Deſolation, as the fayling of their Order wou'd have been for want of Subjects, none preſenting themſelves to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that ſort of Life; a general Chapter held at their great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Houſe by <hi>Grenoble,</hi> to the end they might obtain Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> powerful interceſſion, in what was of the greateſt concern for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their Order, they made a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170805:92"/>Decree in General Chapter, in which they choſe him for the Patron and Advocate of their Order; and they ordain'd, that his Feaſt ſhou'd for the future not only be kept as a Feaſt of Obligation, throu'out their whole Order, but with very great Solemnity; which ſingular Devotion of theirs, was ſo favour'd and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by Saint <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion was ſo Efficacious in the Court of Heaven, that in all Parts of the World where they are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, they have never ſince wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted proper Subjects to encreaſe their Holy Order; and if any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Houſe at any time wants Subjects, 'tis but addreſſing them ſelves to him, and they find his powerful Aſſiſtance; as their Houſe at <hi>Lyons</hi> did ſome five Years ago, where by making a Vow that the Prieſts ſhou'd every Day make a Commemoration of him in their Maſs, they have never ſince wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fit Subjects to Encreaſe their Number.</p>
                     <p>But Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> not only brings Subjects to Religion, but even whole Nations to the Catholic Church; and this was the reaſon that our Fathers gave the Name of <hi>Joſeph</hi> to the firſt <hi>Tarquois</hi> whom they Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd: New <hi>France</hi> alſo owns him for it's Patron, and for the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>s appears in the Example of a very Rich Marchant of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who had great Inclinations to Marry with a Young Woman of quality; but ſhe rejected all Propoſitions in that kind, whereupon he addreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Vow's the give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Alms of a hundred Crowns in his Honour, if he wou'd move her to hearken to his propoſal of Marriage. The Vow was no ſooner made, but he gains her Conſent, and the Marriage is made up, and they liv'd a moſt happy Couple in a Conſtant Peace and Union of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bleſſings in this Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>He aſſiſts Chaſt Perſons alſo and preſerves them from all attempts, that the Enemy makes to Deſtroy
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170805:93"/>in them the admirable Vertue of Chaſtity; as appears in an Example of a Pious Virgin, who being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd in this Point, her Confeſſour adviſes her to have recourſe to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and cauſes her to wear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, a Paper that had touch'd the Miraculous Oyntment at <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,</hi> whereby ſhe preſently found Help and Comfort. As another alſo did, who recommended her ſelf to the ſame Saint, promiſing to wear his Image for nine Days together. I had this Relation from the Perſon her ſelf, who receiv'd this benifit by Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Interceſſion,</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> alſo hears and helps Perſons with Child, as appears by a Votive Picture in the Church of Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> at <hi>Lyons,</hi> on the ſide of his Altar; her Child being Dead for ſome Days within her, ſhe cou'd not be deliver'd thereof. Yet ſhe no ſooner beg'd his Aſſiſtance, but ſhe was Deliver'd of it half putrifi'd, with ſafety alſo of her Life, which all diſpair'd of. The like favour happen'd to a Woman at <hi>Trevoux</hi> who by a very hard Labour for three Days together, was brought to the laſt extreamity and danger of Death, in theſe ſtreights ſhe thought of Recommending her ſelf to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and Purpos'd to Confeſs and Communicate in his Honour, and to ſwallow a Paper that had touch'd
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170805:94"/>the Miraculous Oyntment of <hi>Loudun,</hi> which ſhe had no ſooner done but ſhe was happily Deliver'd.</p>
                     <p>He favours alſo Married Priſons, giving them Children, one of the cheif Bleſſings of Marriage. as a Votive Picture in Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Church teſtifies, of one who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Bleſſing, who had no ſooner beg'd his Interceſſion, but within a Year ſhe obtain'd it.</p>
                     <p>But to ſave the ſetting down many other Examples of Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> powerful Aſſiſtance; the Teſtimony of Saint <hi>Tereſa,</hi> and of many others of his, Clyents, whom I have heard avouch the ſame Truth, is that he refuſes nothing that is ask'd him, but provides a remedy in all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, which is a ſufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to make us all have Recourſe to him, with all confident aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our obtaining our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> To exhort all to have Recours to Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in his Powerful Protection.</head>
                     <p>WE ought Piouſly to beleive, that the Mother of God has a knowledge from her Son, of what is good for our Salvation; wherefore if we do but Conſult her, and deſire her to adviſe us what is beſt for us to do to ſecure our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we cannot doubt but ſhe will tell us, <hi>Be Devout to Saint</hi> Joſeph, <hi>love my Dear Spouſe Saint</hi> Joſeph.</p>
                     <p>To prove this Aſſertion I will relate what Father <hi>Balthaſar Alvares,</hi> a great Clyent of hers, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour to the great Devote Saint <hi>Tereſa,</hi> affirm's. Who being one Day Sick at <hi>Valedolid</hi> of a Violent burning Fevaer, one of the Religious that help'd him, ſhew'd him an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of our Bleſſed <hi>Lady</hi> and Saint
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170805:95"/>
                        <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and put him in mind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending himſelf to the Spouſe of the Bleſſed Virgin. <hi>You have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for the Mother of God has expreſſly Commanded me to do ſo.</hi> And as afterwards he own'd, 'twas in the Holy Chappel of <hi>Laurette</hi> where ſhe gave him this Command. She gave the ſame advice alſo to Saint <hi>Tereſa,</hi> who was Father <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thazar's</hi> Penitent, which caus'd her to have ſo great a Devotion to Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> and ſuch a Confidence in him, that ſhe ſtil'd him her Father, and thoſe that follow our Bleſſed Ladies advice in this particular, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch a particular mark of her kindneſs and encouragement upon this account as ſhe ſhew'd S. <hi>Tereſa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It happend that at <hi>Avila</hi> upon the Feaſt of the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> whilſt Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> was carrying on the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Monaſtery, under the Name of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that one Day whilſt ſhe was at her Prayer, ſhe ſaw our Bleſſed Lady upon one ſide, and Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> on the other, ſhewing her extraordinary expreſſions of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and amongſt others, that which gave her an incredible Conſolation, was a familiar treatment our Bleſſed Lady us'd towards her, takeing her by the Hand, and giving her thank's for her Affection to her doar Spouſe; and for her particular Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. After theſe thanks ſhe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170805:95"/>ptomis'd her all ſorts of Aſſiſtance in her Pious deſign, and in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of her Affection, ſhe made her a Preſent of a Collar or Chain of Gold, with a Croſs hung at it, ſet with Precious Stons ſo reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as ſhe never beheld the like. This made Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> uſe her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to induce and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade all to a Devotion to her Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Patron. And without doubt were we ſo happy as to Converſe with the Saints now in Heaven, they wou'd joyn with her in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading us to ſo Pious and Profitable a Work, by their own Example: For we Read in Saint <hi>Gertrud's,</hi> Life that upon the Vigil of the <hi>Annunciation</hi> of our Bleſſed Lady, ſhe perceiv'd all the Saints in Heaven bow their Heads in honour of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whilſt his Name was Recited in the Quire, they looking upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſigns of Joy and Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, to ſee Saint Joſeph Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd upon Earth as they Honour him in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Since therefore the Queen of Saints and Angels, and all the Saints and Angels themſelves, take ſuch a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in ſeeing Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, can we think it proceeds from any other reaſon, than becauſe they ſee this Honour done Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> highly pleaſing to God, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to Man. Wherefore let us
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170805:96"/>upon this account renew our Pious Reſolutions, of rendring him all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and of Honouring him abore all next to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> Let us reſolve to honour him all the Days of our Lives, eſpecially upon his Feaſt Days, ſince ther's none more Belov'd, nor none more Worthy of our Love, than he, next to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> Who obliges his Lovers by all ſorts of Favours, Wins their Devotions by Miracles, eſpecially in matters of Life and Death, both in Body and Soul, as well for this Life as the next, and who moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily and favorably grants what ever is ask'd, and procures us a free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>

                     <p>Saint <hi>Tereſa</hi> making a Voyage with ſome of her Religious to Found <hi>Vies</hi> was gon out of the right way, and ſo engag'd with her Company among

That way,</hi> reply'd he, which ſeem'd impoſſible for a Wagon to go to; but on a ſuddain they found themſelves Miraculouſly put into it, at which time they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to find out the the Old Man to thank him, but in vain as S. <hi>Tereſa</hi> foretold, who aſſur'd them 'twas her good Father Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who had freed them from the great langer they were in.</p>
                     <p>'Twas for this Reaſon that the Exorciſt of Siſter <hi>Jean</hi> of the <hi>Angels,</hi> Prioreſs of the <hi>Vrſulins</hi> at <hi>Loudun,</hi> who knew his goodneſs and power, thoſe him for his Protectour in this work: For the Devils complain'd of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> by whoſe means they cou'd not moleſt the Religious at her Devotions.</p>
                     <p>And to prove that Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> even helps without being ask'd, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting our Prayers, the following paſſage that hapen'd at <hi>Lyons</hi> in the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170805:97"/>Month of <hi>September</hi> laſt paſt, 1638. do's evidently prove; which I had from the Perſons own Mouth, and is as follow's.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Peter Evialvin</hi> a Rich Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, coming upon the eighth of <hi>September,</hi> our Bleſſed Ladies <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> with a Friend of his to the Church of Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> after ſome Diſcourſe with his Friend, who was a Client of Saint <hi>Joſeph's,</hi> about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Graces and Favours that Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> beſtow'd upon his Clients; and of the Merits of this great Saint; conceiv'd a great deſire to take him for his Advocate, and reſolv'd to frequent his Church and to heat Maſs in it the Thurſday and Friday following. The next Sunday, within the Octave, upon which he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Protection, as he walk'd in the Fields for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſment, he met two Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him, one of which ſhot at him with a Blunderbuſs, charg'd with thirty hail-ſhot, all ente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170805:97"/>whom his Wife alſo makes a Vow; which ſucceeded ſo well, that her Husband recover'd his Hurts, within five Days and came to give thanks at Saint <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Church for this Preſervation, being perfectly well, and there Offer'd a Picture of this Miraculous eſcape, as a memory of his Gratitude.</p>
                     <p>Give me leave therefore to end this Treatiſe by joyning my Petition with Saint <hi>Tereſa's</hi> and beſeeching you if you'll not Beleive me yet, for the Love of God that you wou'd make tryal how advantagious the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to this great Saint is, and how proſperous you'll find it by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: For I have not ſayd all I might have ſayd, there being greater Advantages in Loving and being Devout to Saint <hi>Joſeph,</hi> than the moſt perſwaſive Panageriſt, is able to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. But beleive me who will, and let them that will Imitate me alſo, I for my Part am reſolv'd to Love Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> for Time and Eternity, not with a languiſhing but flaming Love, thereby to redeem time loſt, nor will I prefer any object under God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; for next after <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary, Joſeph</hi> ſhall have place in my Affections, in which I will perſever to my laſt Breath, which ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in pronouncing theſe Sacred Names <hi>Jeſus, Maria, Joſeph:</hi> Live <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Amen.</p>
